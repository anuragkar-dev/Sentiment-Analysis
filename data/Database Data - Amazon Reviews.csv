,B09TRF4LM9,R100AEOXPX3ZP7,5.0,"wasn't sure about an off-brand, but this charger works great! Doesn't overheat and charges very rapidly.",
,B09BG6DSBY,R101PRE3GXWPG7,2.0,"These are so slow!! Even with an extra storage card, they run so slow.",
,B08438H4GM,R102U9PYQ6S094,5.0,"So I've tried several different docks and this seems to be the best for my new MacBook Air M1. I wanted to write a review because everybody is reviewing for Pro's and the Air is different BECAUSE of the power adapter that comes with it. The Air comes with a 30 watt power adapter so when I would plug it in through the dock it would not charge. The work around is to get a 60 watt power adapter which is also still compatible with the Air. The issue is the dock uses some of the power and not all of the 30 watts goes through to the computer and what little that did go through the computer did not recognize as being enough to charge. The 60 watt is working great and don't worry, I did verify all of this with both Apple and Belkin tech support. I'm using one very large external monitor (this doesn't work with dual monitors on the M1...not a Belkin thing it's and apple thing) both USB ports for various things and the 3.5mm sound out to a mixer/speakers and the charger for the computer.  It is really convenient as I only have to plug in the one thing into the thunderbolt and everything is up and running. The cable is short but I use my computer as a second screen and have a raised docking station for it to be at eye level. I mounted this dock to the back of that stand in the upper left so the connector just literally loops around and in. Very happy so far and will update if that changes.",

,B0BRTGTH8R,R106ADEM54ZA39,5.0,"Came in a nice envelope ready to mail. There is a separate card to write a sentiment that matches. The colors are vibrant and the card is beautiful. It is easy to stand up. I ordered 2 different ones and they are both pretty and sturdy. The price is good for the product received. Also, The cost to mail it was reasonable ($2.35 US domestic). Would recommend.",

,B07DY16W2Z,R10F95LI22DFOC,1.0,It worked great at first but after few months it stopped working and had a tech look at it and tried to fix it but was told it would be better to buy another modem. After it stopped working the internet was so bad you could barely get the WiFi working.probably go with a different brand.,
,B0000DH8HQ,R10FJKI1BTDCZ,1.0,I ordered the 6 pack of tape. There was only 5 in the pack.,

,B0CP9YB3Q4,R10G9HKYX77RUT,4.0,"I really like this cup, but it could be better. 1st it's not water proof unless you buy the little accessory. That's the only way. 2nd it keeps ice for 2 to 3 days depending on how much you put in it. The last thing I have to say is water, because that's all I put in mine, does not stay cold without ice. I find myself buying ice just for my cup. Even if I just put water, no ice and sit in the refrigerator, the water will still not be as cold as I think it should be. Leaving it on the night stand over night with no ice, the water will be room temp.",
,B0CN8TJ5V2,R10IC6SM6KLJ2D,3.0,Cute just thought the inside would be bigger. It’s cute but the colors are a little darker than what it looked like on Amazon.,

,B08HQJKD3G,R10JGLIJH4EBNL,4.0,"I didn't pay much attention because I was so glad to find it, but I do prefer silver. The gold color is just a little more ""brazzy"", but it is a gift for someone who won't mind. I am sure it will be received well.",

,B08Z1LTDDY,R10XAX929QMCYW,5.0,These cards are incredibly well made for the price. The design is beautiful and looks exactly like the photo but even more special in person. Even the envelope is great quality paper! I love. Will definitely be buying more from this seller,
,B08Z1LTDDY,R10YQ2C6K4R4S7,2.0,"Overall look of the card is great, but the inside is delicate and was already partially ripped when I received the card. Too much hassle to return, but I won’t purchase this brand again.",
,B0B3SQK74L,R10YX4EA7FFNWI,2.0,Upgraded to this because I have some 6e devices. 6e never works correctly. Slow downloads vs my old router (have gigabit internet). Mishandled traffic something awful. Frequent disconnects. Will be upgrading to a udm pro se very soon. Don't waste your money on this.,
,B09PQF39PG,R10Z3MKUQ6AR58,5.0,Zaps them quick fast and in a hurry 😂😂,

,B073H8STZ7,R11084622UMTQJ,5.0,This is the third blanket I have ordered. The colors are so beautiful and vibrant. The material is so soft but the best part is it’s not a heavy blanket. It’s on the thinner side so it’s perfect to use for the summer. My whole family loves them so we had to get one for everyone!,

,B09688VRYZ,R1157IMOKD7286,2.0,Second charger bought in just a few months and after 6 weeks the silver part that plugs into the laptop snapped off. The first one stopped working after 8 or 9 weeks when the wires came apart from the charger. You get what you pay for I guess.,
,B010A7TZ76,R115OVRDWP5PN4,1.0,"Don’t waste your money on this printer, it won’t even connect to WiFi. Bought this as a replacement for the first one that died. Canon used to be top of the line, but they’ve gone backwards so far that we actually thinking about switching back to HP.",

,B086WNKLTM,R1184M9YXP5WIP,5.0,"We are in the shipping business and were looking for something sturdy, waterproof and with enough capacity to hold quite a few smaller packages to make hauling them to the post office easier. These bags are great! Roomier then expected, sturdier then expected. I absolutely love them.",
,B09GHV6G55,R118EGJC5VS512,5.0,"This works for my Dell laptop and also my MacBook, as they both take the same charger. Highly recommend",
,B00JH98GR4,R118OSTG25GDDB,4.0,"This vacuum sucks up everything; I was quite surprised at it pulled out of my carpets, that I thought were clean. It is a little small for a whole house and the dirt catcher has to be emptied regularly.",
,B001CE8JPQ,R119YYG1AVBRYM,5.0,I don't know how to sew and this product has helped me be able to easily and quickly hem several pair of pants and curtains - projects I'd previously been putting off because of expense and lack of time to find a seamstress.

I contacted Amazon regarding the missing spoon and I received a replacement one with the spoon the next day! So very glad I didn’t have to order a new one and wait because it was a Mother’s Day gift for my daughter in law.",
,B01MRHXM0I,R11CDB5XIUZGB8,4.0,I like that it works very well catching bugs. I don’t like the sour smell. If you have pets place the container where they can’t knock it over because then dead bugs and stinky liquid spills out.,
,B00O0M46KO,R11EGNXQS2ESHE,3.0,"First of all, I thought it was all-in-one (it should be for the price) but the power cable has to be plugged separately. Also, I have no USB ports on my computer, only USB C, so back it goes.",
,B0030MIHAU,R11EM320P9HBX7,5.0,This item works as it is supposed to. It will easily pluck out dandelions. I do tend to think that they sprout up faster than I can remove them though. A lot of other type of weeds can be removed just as easily. The only thing I have found difficult is grass runners getting started in the mulch beds.,
,B00MRH9NCK,R11EZF49EQHLC8,1.0,Nit sure what are those dirt on the protwctor but it is too difficult to remove them.,

,B00WR23X5I,R11IOLDY0BWMO5,5.0,"Printed out my second book, one more to go. I bought two of them. A bit pricey for #63 some other little less. Over all it is needed. Yes, it's easy to install. Dryes quickly and print Quality is a plus. Sending my 3 book copies to library of Congress for copyright. Love it.",
,B0BHC14143,R11JVI6I2XSVGA,5.0,These tumblers are amazing! They leak way less than a Stanley and half the price. I own quite a few of these and a few Stanleys and I highly recommend this tumbler over a Stanley hands down,

,B0BMTPC44X,R11PLM24HCVO0S,5.0,Love this. It not only looks nice it protects my computer desk. It’s just the right thickness. My husband likes to put his coffee cup or water bottle on the computer desk and it was ruining the desk. Now I don’t have to worry about it. And it wipes off easily. Also I don’t need a mouse pad.,
,B06XSB4M8J,R11R21ZY21SSEG,5.0,Paper works great and prints well.,
,B0BCF2VC6M,R11RT7N0WXWZ9S,5.0,The media could not be loaded. Cute Mothers Day gift. A little smaller than expected but perfect for flower bed decorations.,
,B09N72FMH5,R11SL7WNXDWNIE,1.0,"When you put it in repeater mode, you no longer have access to the gui. You have to factory reset it. The factory reset button worked 3 times before never working again. I smashed it and tossed it in the garbage.",
,B0BL5TKDVG,R11T85HHTOYERZ,5.0,Bought for my 1.5 yr old and she loves it. She easily uses this and her sisters iPad. Definitely don’t regret this purchase!,
,B0C58N5J9Q,R11TIE35TSUAPC,1.0,"The power supply seemed to operate OK until I tried to over-night charge my Belkin dual charger - which I have done every night since I received the power supply from Amazon. When I removed my phone and watch from the charger this morning, neither device received any charge. I tried several different traditional methods to get the power supply to function, (plug it into a different electric outlet, different charger cord, etc.), without success. I tried a different power supply with the Belkin charger which performed as expected. I cannot give this power supply any rating above zero stars.",

,B07WQ1VZKW,R11ZPTNN7Y4HOG,2.0,"I like the variety and colors, but the stickies aren’t even that sticky. The sheets were falling apart from each other just holding it.",

,B08PDNCMMN,R120T3524H7EUO,2.0,Not very effective at all. The refills are about $13.,
,B00Q7OAN50,R122J2EOOY3K7L,5.0,"I have purchased quite a few of these set already in different colors. All were great quality, very soft, and wash easily without shrinkage or loss of shape. The mattress sheets stay put which is always a bonus. I love that they also come in twin XL for dorm rooms.",

,B0B2J7WSDK,R128ABY03N60JN,5.0,"I personally use this as personal network storage It has alot of useful features I don't know what's WAN Port doing? Maybe internet input LAN is also can be internet input I have no idea I can connect my 2 PC storage wireless now I might not be able to use all of the features because network storage feature is more than enough for me This can connect to 1 wifi This can share 5Ghz and 2.4Ghz, both active at the same time 2 Admin, 2 guest, so 4 wifi output That's nice For future improvement, i think it would be great if this can connect to 2 wifi, built in battery wifi 7, ssd instead of micro sd, bitlocker ssd if possible MX Player Pro is working best with this on android, 4k 60fps is ok but 8k 60fps is no",
,B0B28PCDM2,R128P8ZBBCN6B0,5.0,"Love this stand, I've had it for a few months and it lets me charge my deck out in open while I still feel it is safe and secure.

,B0CT2R7199,R12BR3CGYHQA6D,1.0,"Printer worked great then had some severe connectivity issues. But even worse than that HP will hold your printer hostage over the instant ink subscription! So to keep using the printer you already paid for, now you MUST pay them an additional monthly fee or throw out perfectly good ink just to get some “non-subscription” cartridges. What a joke! I am also amazed that this bait and switch tactic is somehow legal…. Beware of this outright SCAM and look elsewhere for a printer!",
,B08HV3MPFD,R12BTE0IXIL974,5.0,"I bought it, used it once, threw it in a drawer, and forgot about it.  Two years later I need to print an FAA tag for a drone. By some miracle, I remember this things existence and find the exact spot I left it in.  I didn’t even need to charge it. It booted right up, I downloaded an app and typed in the license, print my label, stick it on my drone, and back in its crypt the label maker goes (likely for another 2 years).  I think it’s safe to say it’ll work then too. 5 stars.",

,B08ZK39NSL,R12FB6YI63CXW4,5.0,"I have been using Eero and many iterations of their products for years.

,B00S1TC442,R12GXOZ6E9MMWT,3.0,"This insert is super comfortable and after following instructions for getting it to inflate/rise it was so nice to sleep with. I got a king size to go in a queen duvet and it gives my bed a very cozy, full look and does cover my entire queen bed without too much hanging off either side.  I’ve followed the laundering instructions on this and my insert has ripped after 2 washes… super disappointing because the comfort is great. The filling is able to come out and it’s not repairable by sewing sadly.",

,B072FVQNWM,R12QH53G12ASYM,5.0,"I have printed thousands of pages on this paper over the past 5 years, and I will never buy another brand.

,B09BFQG17F,R12RSD8L8W2EHT,1.0,It is not silk. They are selling polyester as silk. You can take a small piece of the fabric and burn it to see. The fabric burns and becomes hard like when plastic burns. This shows it’s polyester. Silk buttons like fabric and becomes brittle. Very bad company!!,
,B0B45RTFQH,R12SXJ2KRA9FL,5.0,"love that you get two identical sets of 5 pens when you order. one set of 5 pens has lasted me a semester, they have pretty much all dried out now. idk if you would consider that good or bad but i love the look and the way it writes as well as the grip, it has a soft feel and the colors are really cute so to me its good bang for your buck for two sets of pens that will last you a whole academic year.",
,B0C58N5J9Q,R12UABDUVLQM8W,5.0,Charges fast and shipped quickly.,
,B08KXKVT4K,R12URVPYHVDHOA,5.0,Very sturdy. Bumpers for the bottom make it so they don't move around. Easy to switch around depending on needs. I should have bought more sets.,

,B0B1L6R9NN,R12XSVDVWKCJHD,4.0,"I bought this to limit how long I sit when working. It works good for that purpose. I wish it was taller, but because of my height (5’2) it’s almost eye level. If you are taller, maybe look for an alternative. It doesn’t extend up but can either be completely straightened or bent to adjust the height. The ease of bending it was also greatly exaggerated in the reviews. It’s not as hard as people describe. It is stiff, but it takes seconds to bend down for transport, and the material is ideal depending on the weight of your laptop. It also fits in a standard laptop bag.",

I typically keep a couple on hand and routinely wash them after 2-4 weeks of use, anticipating that they'll last several years. I bought this fabric one as a replacement to my ""hard water stained"" liners and was a bit disappointed at the flimsy/thin fabric. Although it's priced well, I expect I'll buy a more expensive version to get a thicker more durable fabric liner.",

However, when I got the fire 8 to replace my daughter's old fire tablet that was ready to retire, I was incredibly disappointed with how slow this version is!  Trying to use the tablet is an exercise in patience for me as an adult, much less my 9 year old. It will even give problems just trying to change the brightness level.  Overall I'm disappointed and honestly debating returning it and getting a different brand, and finding an app I can use for parental controls instead, because this is ridiculous.",

The ink color is more gray than black but flows smoothly like any other gel pen. And it actually erases! The eraser is tough but with some gentle rub, the ink does erase. I would recommend this pen to anyone who uses whiteout fairly regularly and give this a shot. And with the price of the pens, it is worth a try.",

I’ve owned it for months now, but we only use it for my daughter on long car rides and plane trips, so maybe I’m just not familiar enough. But it really shouldn’t be this hard.  If I were to suggest some changes- we need a fewer words, cleaner menus, and more consistent touch patterns. Am I supposed to click this? Drag this down? Do I need to hit this circle or this square or this triangle? We need a more intuitive interface. We need a start up with account selection, a menu button, then a clear route to settings.

This dock manages to do just that brilliantly.  Setting it up was straightforward; I connected one monitor via HDMI and the other through DisplayPort. Both screens work seamlessly, providing crisp and vibrant visuals without any lag or distortion. An added bonus is the dock's ability to charge my MacBook, which helps reduce cable clutter and keeps my workspace neat and organized.  Overall, if you're in the market for a dock that supports multiple high-resolution displays and offers the convenience of charging your MacBook, the Belkin dock is an excellent choice.

I even tried physically wiping down the printer heads after with a qtip.

Sure, I'm already pretty invested into this, so I'll start an online chat.

I did contact customer support. I got basically to strings of emails one from somewhere and another from Hong Kong. They basically said I had to return the device first, then once returned they would then send me a replacement if deemed broken.

The VPN and Protecting you better from phishing and virus isn't a must have when it comes to networking.  I would have been even more P'd if I paid for the top tier 7 and it had a paywall.  It's my own fault to not doing more research on the app rather basing my decision on the performance reviews.  It has been one of the easiest setup, the range is decent, and so far it's doing what I need it to do.  They put parental control behind the paywall to force you to pay the monthly or yearly fee. Ridiculous, eero brand and other brands need to be avoided if parental control isn't included. I have adult children so I don't have the need for this feature, but come on.  Hardware is, app, and setup are 5 stars.  The paywall for parental control and network data are 1 star and in my opinion very deceptive.",

This was one of the cheaper options so I decided to go with it. I guess you get what you pay for. Now I'm out $20 and have a half done project to pick up next weekend.

GARBAGE. AVOID. My Orbi was an unstable system, but way better than this junk. Unfortunately, I threw away the box and I can't return it.  ORIGINAL This mesh system is supposed to cover 4500 SF??? My house is about 1500 SF, and the coverage is terrible. My desk is in the back bedroom, 22' from one satellite (wood walls, not metal...) and 27' from another and I get 1.85 MBps download! Setting up was very problematic, also. AND, I had to switch all my partner's Alexa devices to MY account (which was also a huge pain in the butt) because they have to be under the same account to work correctly. I replaced an Orbi system because it was so unreliable, not thrilled with EERO 6+ either.",

I literally spent several hours for 6 days reading questions from others about how they couldn't connect theirs either.  Next, forget all of the wonderful features Canon has offered for decades... this is a bare bones printer. There's no panel interface, it has just a a black and color copy button, a stop button, wifi and power. Dedicated scan button? If only. Estimated ink levels? Not a chance.  Speaking of ink, this printer doesn't have the individual colors, just the color ink and the black ink, which is super wasteful. For instance, if you use a lot of Cyan but not Magenta, your color ink cartridge will be ""out"" once you no longer have blue.  Additionally, the photo quality is terrible. It's blurry and the colors are off. After my previous Canon printer stopped after a year and a half and Canon said they no longer supported the model, I was hesitant in spending another $350 on a printer. But this is trash. Even the standard printing is barely legible. That last picture is the last page of my bank statement and should say, This Page Intentionally Left Blank, but you wouldn't know it.",

The durability for one move (that included professional movers throwing them on a truck) is great. I filled some of them where it was hard to pull the zipper and the bag held up in those cases as well. I recommend these to anyone who is moving, wants a reusable product that takes up less space than tubs, and an easy to use product. I plan to use these between moves for groceries and holiday stays at my moms which includes bringing foods, gifts, clothes, etc. these will work so much better than the smaller reusable grocery bags!

The pebble pattern looks great and is prettier than a plain clear curtain. I chose the 8G thicknesses because I am using in conjunction with a fabric shower curtain. Previously, I have used a thicker plastic curtains but they are too thick and stiff. It makes it harder to move the curtain along the curtain rod. With this curtain, I can effortlessly open and close the curtain. Also, I want to mention that the magnets along the bottom of the curtain work just like they should. They are not strong magnets, but that is intentional. If that were strong, it would make the curtain hard to open and close and would eventually cause you to tear the curtain. I typically change these plastic curtains every year or two, and I intend to buy another one too keep as a future replacement.",

This means that your laptop isn't going to move on you. But it also means that you will need two hands to raise and lower it.  It is very sturdy.

It had to travel through the mail over three thousand miles and to make sure it arrived intact, I placed it in a large padded envelope (Avery-Amazon) and printed Do Not Bend on the outside and all arrived in perfect condition. The charge to mail this was 5.00 but a lot less expensive including the card than buying real flowers and it will give the recipient lasting enjoyment with wonderful and thoughtful memories of the sender.

A few evenings later, I heard a squeak and the shuffling sound of the trap moving on the kitchen tile. Upon inspection, there was no mouse, but a small blood spot and a tiny patch of fur attached to the glue. It appeared that the curious mouse walked onto the trap and, despite some difficulty, managed to pull itself off.  Despite leaving the traps out for another week (and adjusting their locations), nothing similar happened involving a mouse. After watching a few youtube videos, which highlighted the ineffectiveness of glue traps and the cruelty of the traps (on the few occasions when they do work), I ordered a set of mechanical traps. Using peanut butter for bait, these mechanical traps (of the snapping jaw variety) were not only better at attracting mice, the mechanical traps were considerably more effective (but not foolproof or instantaneously fatal).  I understand why people might want to use glue traps because they are easy to lay out, but based on my limited experience, I'd suggest using something else to deal with rodents.",

I can’t ever remember how to empty the bin and start pushing on the red levers which only loosens other parts. I like that you can just rinse the filter and reuse. The hoses come out of the handle so it’s a little clunky to push back and forth. Like I said, fine for a $160 vacuum but doesn’t compare to higher end brands.",

I finally concluded that I needed to get a new set of sheets that are cotton 100%. I received the sheets two days ago, washed them and then put them on my bed. What a relief to have cotton sheets again. Yes, I only had one set of sheets for some period of time and now that I have changed to cotton I will be ordering a second set so I can easily change my bed sheets on a more routine basis.

,B0874M3KW4,R1VVIZLIFFF43I,2.0,"I bought two of these to try to consolidate the cables going to the two laptops I use all day (and that I often need to pack up and take away from my desk). Both of these new hubs had the same problem: They dropped keystrokes as I typed.  Some details:  The keyboard and mouse both come in via the same USB-A plug. The hub they were replacing had only one monitor connection (which is why I was replacing it), but it never dropped keys. I confirmed that both of these new hubs drop keys, even if the keyboard/mouse connection was the _only_ one attached to the hub (no monitors, no USB-C power, etc.). I tried both USB-A ports on the hubs, and the behavior was the same. I went back to the old hub and confirmed that everything works again. I also confirmed that the keyboard and mouse work fine on a different computer. No matter the configuration, if these hubs are in use, keys drop, and if they are not, keys do not drop.  They were dropping probably 10-20% of key presses on average, sometimes with whole words missing. It's infuriating. The mouse looked fine, but maybe the mouse is sending so much data that it's not as obvious. Not sure about that.  I'm giving it two stars because if you just want 2 monitors, a mouse, and USB-C power, it seems to work just fine. (I didn't test the networking or the card readers.) But for me the keyboard is crucial.  In any case, I'm going to have to return these.

Because I did not put it on the other suction setting. Then the light came on and the rollers were spinning.

The Bad: 1) The keyboard is hands down the most unresponsive touch screen I have seen in over a decade. It takes two minutes to type ""Soccer Game - Field 3"". This is the single reason we are returning. It is horrible. All 4 of our family members tested it to make sure it was same for all of us. 2) There is no auto correct/spell check. With kids using this and others with dyslexia (or just general horrible spelling) why in gods name was this not added!? 3) It won't capitalize the 1st letter of 1st word in each event. This is a small thing - but I don't want my calendar to look like a 12 year old made it, all in lower case unless you use slower than molasses keyboard to capitalize each word. 4) You cannot customize the views of the calendar (specific number of days to view) or view just the weekend ect. 5) No alarms! 6) No voice to text!!! This is crazy! 7) No battery at all - 100% had to be on a wall at all times. 8) No Widgets or apps- I would PAY for them! 9) Calendar will not allow you repeat events like a google/apple calendar will (example: every Thursday or 1st of each month ect) - lack of specific repeating events is mind boggling. 10) You cannot view the weekly weather. Or any variation of the weather.  The Good: 1) It's heavy and well built 2) It looks clean 3) Easy setup  This is a great 1st edition.

This thing turned out to be an absolute hit on both occasions. The statue exudes a charm and elegance that makes it a perfect addition to any garden decor. The solar aspect is great -- no need to fiddle with batteries.  One of the most appealing aspects of this statue is its versatility as a gift. Whether it's for a birthday, a special occasion, or just a thoughtful gesture, it carries a sense of thoughtfulness and uniqueness. The statue's design is sophisticated yet has a certain warmth to it, making it an ideal decor piece that can enhance any outdoor or indoor space.  As a proud supporter of the Alabama Crimson Tide, adding a ""Roll Tide"" note to the gift made it even more special and personal. In summary, the Goodeco Elephant Statue is a fantastic gift choice for anyone who appreciates art, nature, or simply loves unique home decor items. It's a gift that brings joy and beauty, and I couldn't be happier with the decision to buy a couple for some great women in my life.",

It's so powerful, and the performance is solid. Overall, we are very happy with device and highly recommend it, especially for those who have a T-Mobile business cell phone plan, which usually offers an extra line for free. Since we have an extra line and extra cell phones, and T-Mobile offers 200GB premium HS data, this little device connects to our existing switch effortlessly. We were worried about the cell phone battery draining, but since we dedicate this cell phone line for our networking, the cell phone connects to this device all the time, so the phone battery has not been an issue at all. We are pleasantly surprised that this device delivers a steady T-Mobile 5G HS speed, and the WiFi signal reaches farther, which is much better than what we have with AT&T fiber internet. So we canceled our AT&T Fiber internet subscription. The only thing is the device is kind of hot while running, but we got this $13 super quiet fan from Amazon https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00G05A2MU?psc=1&ref=ppx_yo2ov_dt_b_product_details, which really cools it down :-)",

Security on the Go:  VPN Powerhouse: The Opal shines with its ability to run a VPN client. This allows you to connect to your preferred VPN service, encrypting your internet traffic and masking your online activity on unsecured hotel Wi-Fi networks. Peace of Mind: Knowing your online activity is encrypted can provide peace of mind when using public Wi-Fi, especially for activities like online banking or checking sensitive emails.  Additional Features:  Compact and Portable: The tiny size makes it easy to pack in your carry-on without weighing you down. Dual-Band Wi-Fi: It offers dual-band Wi-Fi (2.4GHz and 5GHz) for a more stable and reliable connection compared to relying solely on hotel Wi-Fi.

I reused the apple containers but any small plastic container will do. Took about 2-3 weeks to eradicate them. Watch YouTube for instructions, save yourself a lot of money. Apple cider vinegar, 1 drop dish detergent & your set. I also used baking soda & plain vinegar in each drain at night, allow it to foam up, close the drains, fill sink with about an inch of water. Another tip is if you have a garbage disposal try to keep that drain closed as much as possible when not in use. PS - I also tried Green Gobbler it did absolutely nothing.",

Some seem to overlap between the fan and remote while others don't. Also, the icons on the buttons aren't exactly self-explanatory: for instance, what does a leaf mean? Apparently, ""natural mode.""

I have a few security cameras on the exterior and I had to place nodes literally within 10 feet of cameras to get them a strong signal. They were lagging bad and now they drop off and have to pair them like every day. I run several iot devices like smart bulbs, plugs, relays etc. have tvs, iOS devices all set up on mesh. Full time job trouble shooting and was expecting this was going to be the solution. It works but pretty crappy and unstable. I’m plugged directly into AT&T router and have a good signal to main Deco.

I will most likely buy more.",

However, when I used these, I found mine very stiff - no 'down' feel at all - and very, very HOT!! I can't even use them! Silly me, I had already thrown the packaging away so now they cannot be returned. I'm so sad, I was so looking forward to these.

I ended up returning BOTH of those items within 2 days. I could not find a reason to have the stylus and the keyboard was clumsy.

The color is beautiful and soft and gentle, the little bear design is absolutely adorable, it's so useful being a flashlight AND charger AND fan, and it's tiny so it can fit anywhere! The flashlight was surprisingly powerful imo, like not super bright but it isn't weak either. Similarly, the fan was decent. It's what I was most worried about, since it's so small and the blades appear so weak, but it was up to my standards! (And my standards weren't low, either). On a scale of 1-10, if 1 is barely any wind and 10 is about to blow my face off, it sits maybe at a comfortable 6? I think it'll be good enough, it's pretty comfortable. (Allow me to reiterate that 10 is literally ""about to blow my face off,"" which means 9 is somewhere way too strong and 7 and 8 are super strong. This isn't that strong but it is NOT weak). This seems perfect, its versatility is absolutely amazing, it is adorable, and exactly as advertised. I love this product so much!!",

,B0C9V811L6,R29I6Z2RIZNNX6,5.0,"We've had many visual calendars over the years. When my sons learned to read we started doing a white board calendar. I got so tired of updating it daily with the entire play by play schedule, especially when I'm taking that play by play directly from my Google Calendar off my phone. I started looking into digital calendars. I preferred the price of the 10 inch calendar but really felt we needed a larger one closer the 15 in. The price seemed a bit excessive to me so I waited for a few weeks on this Calendar. I finally convinced myself this would be an investment that will last for years and solve a problem for years to come. We got it last week and I'm very happy we did. It's very easy to use, easy to set up, and straightforward. The kids love it and already use it and go to it the same way they always have for their visual schedules. This is already making my job a lot easier. Glad to retire the white board.",

I went outside today and for the first time ever there were not cobwebs on my fence and outdoor furniture which I constantly cleaned up every single day.

Everything that the help site said to do did not work. I now have my laptop plugged into the dock and also a separate power supply. I haven't given up yet but so far nothing has helped. I have a Dell Inspiron 16 5635. Both items are brand new.,

,B09BVKYWJ5,R2FI7OIMRKR43R,5.0,"I bought this cord to replace my old Apple cord that lasted all of a year or two. And to be honest with you, I got tired of replacing my official Apple product so often. So I said to myself, just get something cheap because I plan on getting a new laptop soon. So far, it has endured over a month of use and I haven't had any issues with it. It readily charges my laptop at the same rate as my old official one and it doesnt get overheated and such. Nor has the plug portion become twisted and bulging. As for the price, it can't be beat.",

This little chopper is amazing! I can now make a salad in just a few minutes and eat it right out of the base of this chopper. It chops it all right into the base. You just mix it up, add dressing and seeds/croutons and you have a quick meal. I even folded up some deli meat and chopped it into the salad. Clean up was a breeze too. It comes with a brush and a little device to get food out of the crevices, 2 choppers, and 2 slicers. Dishwasher safe.

,B07N3FYTW5,R2FROOD136V846,3.0,"This HP cartridge stopped printing well after a few weeks. Faint print, lines cut off, apparently misaligned. Re-aligning didn't work, because the quality of the printed scan/align page wasn't good enough for the scan to properly align. Of course, this happened after the return window closed. Called HP support, after about 3 hours of testing, re-installing, and wasting a lot of paper, the agent offered to send me a replacement. The new cartridge works well so far, so fingers crossed. I'd give HP support 5 for their help and free replacement (out of warrantly), a 1 or 2 to the seller for a faulty cartridge, but I'll up it to 3 because past purchases have worked fine. Of course, like other users have noted, this isn't a cheap solution, and I suspect HP's ""cartridge verification"" is actually part of the problem when cartridges don't measure up.",

,B09PRB1MZM,R2FWY4TQKR53YR,5.0,"I finally decided to replace my cobbled up wifi network with a mesh network. My existing network consisted of a wireless router and two TPLink extenders which worked OK most of the time except that I was constantly dealing with having to reconnect / rediscover my audio streaming devices (WiiM units). The challenge with my configuration is that the house is very long, over 150 feet, 4500 sq ft, and single story, which was my reason for moving to a mesh network. Setup was easy via the app and I was able to keep my existing SSID and password for the network making it easy to transition all my existing devices to the new network with no reprogramming. Download speeds at all locations in the house are great. I have Cox 100 Mb service and I see very little degradation anywhere in the house. And the issues I had with unreliable connections to my audio streaming devices appear to be resolved. Using my tuneblade app on my PC, both devices now consistently show up via the app. If you are looking for value and performance the Deco X55 is the answer.",

I wasted a grand total of over 8 hrs on this thing, & STILL never got it setup! It should take a max of 30 mins to do so!  & I need to set a static IP address for the aforementioned prog I needed to get this router for, & everytime I set it, & then hit SAVE, the damn thing timed out, & gave me an error code. I called their USELESS incompetent tech support, & the 'genius' I spoke to there didn't know what the error code even meant! 🤦‍♂️ She said I had to call back later to speak someone who actually knows what they are doing! Not her exact words, but roughly translated from tardo to English, that is what she was saying!🧐 I was exhausted from being up all night, & crashed, & when I woke up several hrs later, I tried in vain yet again! I even DL'd & installed the latest firmware update for it-this had literally NO EFFECT whatsoever on the problem, BTW!🙄😒 & now, it can't even load the settings page at all for this thing, regardless of what IP address you type into the address bar in the webbrowser!🤬 & their useless 'tech support' just basically told me to call my ISP to have them walk me through this problem! Claiming they couldn't help me set a static IP address in it! Not that it even matters when I cannot even get into the router's settings page!🙄😒 & BTW, Speculum refused to give me the static IP address info too!. It's literally just a set of #'s!🙄😒🤦‍♂️  At any rate, if Zyxel's current crop of routers weren't all $100+, I'd just buy one of theirs, as their tech support aren't incompetent, & they will actually help you, & their products aren't useless crap!  So, I am returning this paperweight, & will buy a diff 1 which is hopefully far better w/far better tech support, & not too expensive, & hopefully actually works w/out crashing everytime you save any settings changes you make, & doesn't fail to open up the IP address page for said settings on the thing too!!  BTW, I'd have given tech support 0 stars, but they won't allow you to!",

There are two ceiling fans but they make this knocking sound if left on high or medium settings and on low sometimes a low ticking/ squeaking sound. This fan has great reviews.

It's not silent on high, but you can easily drown out when on the phone, watching TV, listening to music, or talking. This the first night so let's see how it goes.",

BUT in 2024 what docking station doesn't allow you to charge your laptop with that same chord??? This is the first Dell docking station I could find that has the speaker port which is why I ordered them for our team. But I never would've imagined having to check to see if it charged as well. Our security team requires us to have Dell brand docking stations, which is great if Dell made one like all the other companies.  Dell please make a docking station that has 3 monitor capability, 2-3 usb ports, speaker and microphone ports AND charges your laptop, just like every other company has.",

Kept saying unauthorized. Google this, it's a common issue with no real resolution, no way to troubleshoot, it just does not work on this device. Seems like a fight between Google and Amazon. Ok, I didn't really want the email so let me try something else. I loaded up OneDrive where my MP3s are stored and told it to synch the music directory. It thinks there's nothing to sync but It did not work, no reason why, no way to troubleshoot, no files found in file explorer. The software simply doesn't work on this device. Ok, I try connecting to USB and manage to copy the Music directory onto the device. I can see them in File Explorer. Amazon Music does not see them or recognize them at all, even adding a custom directory and pointing it to my music had no effect. Ok, I try another program suggestion called VLC. It doesn't see them either but they are all there and I can add one song at a time to a playlist and it will play but I have over 4000 songs so adding one at a time is impossible. The option to add all in a folder doesn't work either. NOTHING WORKS ON THIS TABLET.

I am just surprised - I had a cheap Plugable dock that was able to handle two hard drives much better, but of course that broke (for different reasons), but it lasted much longer than this Belkin.  Also for those who didn't know - the usb c port doesn't have charge/energy capability, so if I plugged a computer speaker that uses usb c for power, it couldn't handle that either. So the cheap Plugable one for $17 actually had more capabilities. I'm still figuring out some reasonable solutions that won't break in three weeks.",

The page yield is incredible! This high-yield cartridge has lasted me significantly longer than the standard cartridges, saving me a considerable amount of money in the long run. I can confidently recommend this product to anyone who needs to print frequently without compromising on quality or breaking the bank.  Compatibility was a non-issue, as this cartridge worked flawlessly with my HP DeskJet 4100 Series printer right out of the box. No fiddling or adjustments were required – it was a seamless plug-and-play experience.  I couldn't be happier with my purchase.

,B00JH98GR4,R2PZG379PBRSID,3.0,The media could not be loaded. This vacuum is very loud! It was easy to put together. Seems to have very good suction and is easy to maneuver. Picked up alot of dust/debris. Lift away feature is nice. It's lightweight. There is only one spot to hold the attachments tho so the other one you have to put on top or keep off. They fell off within a few minutes of vacuuming. The cord is not nearly as long as I thought it was and doesn't even reach fully to my back bedrooms of my house. Even when adjusting the section it seemed to have a lot of trouble on my shag rug. The power button and canister are very lower to the ground which causes me to have to bend over to turn on or off or adjust for hard floor to carpet. Overall I think I expected more from this vacuum. I've been using sharks for many years. This one's definitely not my favorite and I think I'll be returning.,

However, I was sorely mistaken and extremely disappointed. The magnets are flimsy and don’t stick to the tub at all. The liner bellows and sticks to me making it uncomfortable to shower. Even with a curved shower curtain rod, water still manages to get through and soak my bathroom floor. Overall this product isn’t much better than a $2 shower liner you can get from Walmart",

Little did i know over half would be chewed up by this print like an untrained dog. Truly a marvel in improper building. The scan top was Flimsy at best and felt like it could snap off with just a little pushing, the interior is unlit which is fine enough but knowing so many printers have a small LED to help guide self repair and ink replacement puts this one behind most.

It also didn’t come with a straw…it came dented on the bottom. Plus when you are trying to drink anything out of it, it doesn’t really let you get any drink it’s like it picks up every ounce of ice and just blocks your straw from getting anything and when you are done it’s like it releases everything.

I think the heat and light attract them most where I am. I will keep getting this as maintenance even when the gnats are gone because the trap doubles as a nice nightlight.,

Since then download speeds and upload speeds have been as low as I have ever seen and they show almost full bars on the app. If you have a very large house I don’t recommend. The home I’m in is about 10,000 sqft and I have plenty of EERO’s in the house to get proper coverage. They tell me to reduce the amount of EERO’s have online, but nothing connects if I follow their instructions. I spent hours on the phone and with the EERO’s moving them and reconfiguring. It’s been nothing but a disaster of time and money. If you have a smaller home I would recommend this product. Big house find something more expensive and better than an eero system.

WTH? Mind you, a gallon is less than 4L and it had the marking for 4L. I am pretty particular about having precise measurements for the poison being distributed, but I was left to guess how much was an exact gallon. Maybe they should rename it to a 4L sprayer. Otherwise, the sprayer is great.",

Out of box, when plugged in, I could connect to it, but I couldn’t get any web interface to load. Trying everything got me nowhere, and I ended up to the point where I just had to do a new firmware flash on it. The firmware recovery flash procedure was pretty easy, but just frustrating that I had to do that on a device that was effectively softbricked out of box. Once flashed, I was good to go. I pulled down a wireguard config from my Unifi Dream Machine at home, dropped it into this little guy, and was quickly browsing and connected through my home network without any trouble.  Even with this experience, I think it’s a great travel router. Just be prepared for some trouble if you aren’t technically inclined.",

I've had it for over six months now, and ever since I hooked up this mesh system, I've been having trouble connecting to the internet. Initially, it occurred once or twice a month, but now it's happening every day. I contacted customer support, and after some diagnosis, they advised me to perform a soft reset, which seemed to work for about a month. Upon encountering the issue again, I reached out to customer service once more. They instructed me to conduct a ping test while the network was down to determine if the problem lay with the internet provider. Subsequently, they suggested replacing the Ethernet cable to ascertain if that was the culprit. I used the same Ethernet cable that came with the eero system. In that case, I told them they should provide me with a new cable, but they didn't respond to that.",

There is full open-source support of the whole thing, and you can run the latest ""vanilla"" openwrt image on it. It all works as far as I can tell.  Running OpenWRT with no hassle is a huge selling point for me. It has a ton of neat features (VPN, for example), it has a nicely-done IPv6 stack, and it allows you to make the router work in very specific ways that many consumer-grade routers don't support. I bought this for the price, and because I needed it to work in a very specific way... and it did exactly that with no fuss.  It's intended to be a travel router, but it's a perfectly good router in a small box, that's all. The antenna are fine for an apartment, and if you're doing most of your connecting over wifi, only 1 LAN port is fine.  The wifi is as fast as my internet service itself (theoretically up to 1G/s) with devices that can handle it.  Bottom line: it's a great travel router, good price, and huge bonus points for using OpenWRT. I'd buy another.",

,B08RCV3MRP,R2XVWL4O2X1CG,5.0,"I was tempted by this seat cover when first looking for one because of the stellar reviews. However, I was off by the price, so I bought a competitor's product.  I bought an Amazon basics seat cover - hey, it was only $25! It's from Amazon, it must be built to at least acceptable standards, right? Wrong! The cutout for the coccyx is much too small, and the pad itself is small. I am not a particularly large man: 5' 8"", 160lbs. I could never get comfortable on it.  I bought another competitor's product, that one about $35, a wedge-shape specifically made for the car. It was great... for the first 2 weeks. That thing lost its shape incredibly fast; again, I only weigh 160lbs.  So I finally caved and bought this one. I didn't have high hopes - I had been burned twice before! But, man, this thing is different. The foam pad has very little give yet is comfortable and soft to sit on. I anticipate that it will last much longer than the others. It has generous space for your coccyx, I don't find myself constantly readjusting my position, trying to find the sweet spot.  Finally, the biggest benefit of this seat cushion that wasn't even on my radar: foam that comes around your bottom and slightly comes up your lower back. It's like you're sitting in a little bowl. This doesn't provide all that much support, however, *this is the magic touch that keeps you in the perfect position on the pad.* It just feels ""right"". I'm not constantly worried that I'll unconsciously shift in my seat and end up touching my spine to a bare wooden chair, causing immense pain. This thing holds me exactly where I need to be regardless of how much I fidget.  TLDR: This thing is 2x to 3x more expensive than competing products.

,B000E28UQU,R2Z8YMACGZSOMH,2.0,"I found this sprayer difficult--possibly even dangerous--to use. It either won't hold pressure or sprayed me in the face. The coupling that secures the hose to the body kept loosening which caused a loss in pressure. Annoying. To keep that from happening, I had to turn the coupling until was so tight, it's just a matter of time until it strips out completely as it's only made of plastic. And, when the coupling does manage to stay tight enough to maintain pressure, there's no way to release that pressure until you unscrew something because there's no pressure release valve. I found it difficult to loosen the top without applying a lot of force, which required that I stand right over it to get enough torque. Then, when I finally got the top to turn, the liquid inside sprayed up into my face. Not good! The instructions warned that this might happen, so Chapin is aware of the problem. But, being aware of it still didn't enable me to avoid it--even though I was SUPER careful and tried to. Fortunately I wasn't using a particularly harmful substance, but it's still not good to get sprayed in the eyes and/or mouth with even natural fertilizers or weed killers. All in all, the product design is defective and potentially dangerous.",

You can purchase the cheap 3 for $10 candles at Michaels but they don't have the strong lasting scent nor do they burn for long. The wax in these doesn't puddle up around the wick, a common problem with some candles. This causes the flame to be extinguished.

Otherwise, if you follow this product's instructions on a machine that is designed to do another descaling process, you will spend a lot more time just to get the same result. Kinda' a bummer.  The other thing? Yes, you can use vinegar instead in most--most--cases. This product contains Citric Acid and Sulfamic Acid. They should state that on the label. They don't. So I am deducting a star. Don't make people hunt for your ingredients. And it is my fault for not noticing that before I purchase it.  So, please do compare the various options before you purchase.

,B0BPSGJN7T,R2ZNHV91OZBA0,2.0,"I had high hopes for this device, after watching several videos on the product. Let me start out by saying that I had no trouble configuring the router using videos i found online, and the travel router worked fine in my home.  Unfortunately, when I took it out on the road, I found that public WiFi networks (such as at hotels, in airport lounges, etc.) actively block routers trying to log on to their networks. Presumably this is done for the security of other network users, to help prevent MITM (Man in The Middle) type attacks, where someone spoofs the network with a similar sounding network name, so as to steal other users information. So this isn't a totally bad thing that these public facilities actively block travel routers, or any kind of router.  The result is that there are a diminishing number of places where you can even use a product like this, because hotel chains and other public WiFi providers will block you from logging on with this and similar travel routers.  There are threads on this problem you can find by online searching, and from what I could find, there is no easy solution. Whether or not you will want to lug this thing around in your luggage once you find that you can hardly use it, well that question is likely to answer itself. This may be one of the best products of its kind out there, but if its use is actively blocked, then it won't be of much use to you, nor is mine to me.",

,B003O2RXUQ,R30R9V607TFOOX,2.0,"The notebook itself is okay. The cover was scuffed and dirty when it arrived, like it had been tossed around before getting to me. The paper is thinner than I'm used to from Mead/Five Star, but it doesn't bleed terribly unless I linger in one place too long. All-in-all it's an affordable, functional notebook. If that's all you care about, this is probably the one.  But the QR codes. I hate the QR codes in the corners of the pages.  For those unaware, Five Star released a study app a few years ago, which you can use to scan your handwritten notes to be digitized for you. Within the app, you can organize them by subject, make digital flashcards, etc. Those QR codes in the corners of each page are so the app recognizes where the page is. The app won't scan in your notes if those QR codes aren't lined up in the brackets of the app's camera. Which means you can't use their app with any other notebooks or paper aside from Five Star.  So, they require you to use Five Star products to use their app, and every notebook you buy from them from now on will have an ugly little reminder in each corner of every page that says, ""HEY WE HAVE AN APP."" The QR codes are obvious, they're ugly, and honestly I find them a little distracting when I'm trying to take my notes.  If I wanted digital notes, I would take my notes directly into one of the literally hundreds of notetaking apps that don't require me to swear fealty to one brand of office supplies. There are also already apps which do essentially the exact same thing, but better (if the Five Star study app reviews are anything to judge by). And those apps don't mar my beautiful clean pages with hideous little boxes.  Every time I see those awful, hideous little digital squares, I'm reminded that Five Star is trying to strongarm its customer base into only ever using their products, and into using products we don't need or want. And maybe I'm overreacting a little bit, but I cannot stress enough how UGLY they are, printed in every corner on every page, taunting me.  I hate them and this will be the last Mead/Five Star product (and in fact, I will strive to ensure this is the last product from the entire ACCO company's family of brands) I buy until those awful QR codes go away.",

I began researching solutions to get around captive WiFis that often prevented me from using several devices, including the Echo Dot. It's made traveling so much easier, and I able to connect everything. After several successful uses at hotels and vacation rentals, I most recently took it to Europe where, again, it worked flawless!y. The best part is that there was no reason to reestablish internet connections on my devices since, no matter where I was, they immediately connected to this router, which they had previously connected to. I made the mistake of printing off the PDF manual; you don't need it. Set up is that simple, and I am no tech expert.

I am pretty heavy handed, and I might need to go to a bigger size.. but I find myself starting with this pen, but then I end up grabbing another pen because I just don't like how it writes. I thought I might have had a bad pen, so I tried all of them and had the same experience, so I think I need to keep looking and possibly go up a size.",

,B0BPSGJN7T,R379H6JSJMOS0D,5.0,"I didn't think I would need a travel router until now. I'm a techy person but I figure I would just download a vpn client to my laptop or phone. But lately, a lot of hotels have been strict on how many devices you can connect. This is a great way to bypass that restriction.  This is very easy to setup. Once it boots up, just browse to the ip address to setup password then you can connect the router to an existing wifi, plug in ethernet, tether your phone and/or use a modem.  I put this pocket-size router to the test on my recent trip. 4 devices. My laptop, 2 phones, a chromecast. This pocket router performed really well. It was able to handle streaming to my chromecast and my laptop was able to remote access to my work computer without a hiccup or slow down. I do have vpn configured on this device.  This router has features not found on a lot of consumer-grade router, like failover to another active network or load balancing. I'm really surprised. At the time of writing, this device consumes about 15-watt. The provided ac plug is great but if you have a high-wattage usb c wall charger, that will work as well.  Adguard home is excellent. It was able to block a lot of advertisements.  Overall this is great to travel with. Especially if you have a family of devices that you need to connect and don't want to pay extra to lift the hotel's device restrictions or if you value safe browsing or safeguarding your data.",

,B08R67QLTM,R39SKAUB2YEVPX,5.0,I visit clients in their home and I have to use a hot spot through my phone for security reasons. I often visit clients in remote areas that make it hard to charge my phone. This is a godsend. The cord it short but managable. I also like to hike in remote areas. It's a comfort to know I can always charge my phone. I use my phone a lot and one full charge keeps me working for over a day!,

,B0B1VQ1ZQY,R39ZM8ABHSJ95U,5.0,I got this kindle 11 to replace my kindle 10. The kindle 11 is much faster than my old kindle. Also it's much more sensitive to touch. I replace my old kindle 10 since I got tired of constantly resetting it to factory settings. It feels a little bit lighter than my previous kindle and setting it up was a breeze. I just received this yesterday and very pleased with it so far.,
,B07S6CBQJG,R3A1B22VW10JT6,5.0,I purchased this charger on March 12th and it's dead by May 4th. Of course the return window expired on April 12 so here I sit with a dead charger. Maybe it was a fluke but with such a short return window I doubt it. Not at all pleased with this purchase so you may want to purchase with caution.,
,B07PCQKTCN,R3A2XEXS88H5LO,5.0,The material is light and soft. Super comfortable to lay on/under! I love that it has a zipper closure (instead of buttons) and ties to the comforter at the top & bottom!,

I truly don’t get the hype and what makes them so much better than any other brand like Simple Modern. This has become my new favorite everyday essential and the color is exactly as pictured and I’m obsessed. I actually really love the fact that the top can be switched into 4 different directions and it stays sealed right.

,B09NM28SB4,R3B30I97G4PGW,2.0,"Having lots of plugs is great but not if the brick doesn’t push enough power. That is the case with this product. It can technically slowly charge my MSI leopard but only if it’s not being used. Using this charger makes gaming impossible, I’ve never had a charger break my game until today. When the PC is using a lot of power they draw from both the batteries and the cable in order to provide enough juice for the CPU and GPU, leading to high preformance, but because this charger provides less than the factory charger the machine gets confused and swaps back and forth between thinking it is charging and not charging, switching preformance modes causes the game to essentially not play. It only switches when the PC is being used for gaming, which is its main purpose so this is totally unusable for me. Even though it adverts for being compatible with my model. It’s only slightly better than not having a cable at all",

I've watched several videos and I still cannot get the thing to work any of my hotel rooms if there is no CAT cable. I did get to use it at my last VRBO because they had a router I could plug into and broadcast WiFi. I have another trip coming up where I will attempt connecting again but if it doesn't work this time I will probably give the unit to my kids and let them figure it out because that will confirm this router is only for Tech savvy folks.,

I keep giving them the old crappy ones that don't cut very well but they don't like those so every time I reach over in my office or the kitchen for the good scissors they aren't there and when I grill, excuse me, question the kids gently, they each angelically reply, ""It wasn't me mom."" So they get the old ones and I'll try and hide these better until I forget and they make off with these again and I will be back here ordering more.

Also, consider the presence of the USB-C port doesn't mean you will be able to easily power from a powerbank. This thing has a power draw of up to 4amps and I have not been able to find a power bank capable of more than 3amp per output. If you're traveling within the US this router makes sense.

The plus version gives you faster charging and slightly better performance. Surprisingly, it is still portable enough for my use. In fact, it feels a lot better in my hands to use in comparison to the 7"" or 10"" and larger tablets that I own. I bought it to use only a few specific apps. But I find myself reaching for it more often than my other tablets to read, for emails, browse internet, social media and games. It's just the perfect size for me. It has 32GB of storage, which is enough for me. The tablet charges very quickly and the battery lasts a couple of days. The screen is pretty bright, touchscreen works well. The cameras are decent, it would have been nice if the front camera was 1080p like the rear one. Since most people don't take pictures with tablets but may use them for video calls. The volume is sufficiently loud for watching videos and listening to music. It has a headphone jack. Beware, the cheaper version has ads on the lock screen. You can pay $15 more for an ad free device. . You are limited to the Fire OS, so make sure your apps are available in the Amazon app store. There are work arounds, if you know, you know.

,B00NNMB3KS,R3FLN3TZAB8F7D,2.0,"Daughter has one, she swore by it, so I got one as well. Not only does it not cool my laptop, but it never cooled my daughter’s, either. Testing with onboard software (ASUS Armoury Crate) shows absolutely no effect with or without the cooling pad. Air coming out of the pad takes the path of least resistance, and just gets pushed out the sides under the laptop. Any actual air that would be drawn up into it is negligible. I added duct tape to direct the air more towards the center of the pad to help with the outflow under the laptop, but not much improvement. It would be a positive that the pad is very quiet, but that just means the fans are low speed and there’s no option to increase their speed to push more air.  Just a complete waste of money.",

It's easy to use and allows you to quickly remove weeds without any strain on your back or knees. I've found that I can remove about 2-3 cubic feet of weeds per hour (based on how quickly I can fill my wheelbarrow). Ideally you'll want to use it within a few days of rainfall when the ground is somewhat soft. I think most of the broken tools are a result of people forcing it into dry hard soil, or into rocks below the surface. If you feel resistance don't force it, just move onto the next weed.",

,B0CX23V2ZK,R3G1251LK509UX,1.0,"As a loyal Apple customer, I recently purchased a brand new MacBook with high hopes of a seamless experience. However, my excitement quickly turned to frustration when I encountered significant issues with the Touch ID functionality straight out of the box.  Upon setup, the Touch ID feature was utterly glitchy, refusing to recognize my fingerprint no matter how many times I tried. It was as if the system had a mind of its own, completely ignoring my attempts to register my fingerprint. After struggling for an entire day, I finally managed to get it to work, only to find that it would still intermittently fail to recognize my fingerprint.  What made matters worse was the lack of support from the Apple Store. Despite purchasing the MacBook from an authorized retailer, the Apple Store refused to initiate a return, citing their policy of not accepting returns on Apple products not bought directly from them.  My advice to potential buyers is to avoid the hassle altogether and purchase directly from Apple. While I've always been a fan of their products, this experience left me deeply disappointed. The Touch ID issue, and subsequently having to return the laptop not only disrupted my workflow, but also made me question the quality assurance standards of such a reputable brand. Proceed with caution, and consider buying directly from Apple to avoid similar frustrations.",

,B0B24QJ217,R3I1Y7CYTOX2V5,5.0,"Just like the title says! If you’re a minimalist that wants a bit of flare, this is it. It’s functional as well since scent comes out of it. The scent doesn’t fill a standard sized bedroom. It does, however, fill a half bath. My bathroom only has the toilet and sink vanity. When you walk in you smell it and I have all reeds in it currently. The less reeds in it, the more subtle the scent. So to fill a small living area you’d need 2-3 of these. I think these are meant for small areas such as small bathrooms since they make such a statement when you look at them, because they’re not small.  I have the coconut lime scent which is a lot when you’re really close but as you get farther away, leave the room for a bit and then come back to it, it gets better. I like summer scents and this one reminds me of summer.  I will be purchasing another one of these for my other bathroom with a different summer scent. I imagine some are stronger than others so I’d keep that in mind. Overall this was a great purchase!",

I put it at the other end of the patio and the majority of the bugs all stay on that side and get zapped. The best part is that it attracts the June bugs.

Support (5 techs) had me either reinitialize, reboot, turn off and wait, or my router was under an attack (was in log) and have my iso change my modem address.  Final draw was when it looked like it was working and I tried watching a short Wi-Fi download video it froze up. I have a 1gb download with no one else using it. I switched to my comcast WiFi router and watched the same short WiFi video with no issue.  Pro: 1. signal strength was great 2. I liked the design and it was easy for me to setup Con: 1.

,B0B3CDZLTB,R3LP4FQRVU2EFW,4.0,"This is what I describe as a ""chill laptop"". It's the reliable, ageless device you park next to your couch and cruise the inter webs on, the computer that transitions to a DJ machine for a party, the one you grab when you need to do some serious professional work. It does it all, it's snappy and the battery life makes you wonder why you ever had to charge a laptop before. Did I mention there isn't any fan noise? It's fantastic.  All of the basics are covered on top of that, speakers are great, keyboard is great, screen is great. This is how Apple makes great devices, by nailing the basics. Mac OS feels limited, but ultimately is a just an adjustment period if you're coming from windows. Most apps and programs work, but make sure before you buy this laptop, as MacOS tends to have some extra hoops to jump through. You can game but it entirely depends what game you're playing and if it's compatible. This is the biggest thing, you need to be slightly tech savvy to get Windows and apps running. Apple wants you to use their apps, which are greatly optimized.  The only real negative is the notch, if it bothers you and the soldered components that are non-upgradeable. I'm not going to get into debates on how much RAM you need but I've never needed more than 8gb for years now and never experience slow down. I also only live in 3 - 5 browser tabs and close down programs I'm not using. If you're cruising the web and using basic apps this computer will easily last you 4 - 5 years and be better than anything on the market. Not to mention the awesome resale value of Macs.",

Microsoft offers docking stations for surface laptops with the price starting at $200 which is quite expensive for my budget. After several days of searching for the right device, I decided to try Dell docking station, and I wasn't disappointed. It works perfectly for me, I can connect 3 external displays (1 in laptop's usb-c port, and 2 displays in the docking station, 1 port remains available) which is crucial for my work. The docking station also comes with multiple usb-a ports and 3.5mm audio port which is very convenient. As a warning, the device is not plug & play and not identified by windows on my laptop, I had to download a driver from Dell website.

,B082PMRSBK,R3OT6ACZAXM1M5,5.0,"As a busy professional who relies heavily on note-taking and document editing, I can confidently say that the SHARPIE S-Gel Gel Pens are an absolute game-changer. These pens have become an indispensable tool in my daily business operations, and I can't imagine using anything else.  From the moment I started using these gel pens, I was impressed by the smooth, effortless writing experience they provide. The 0.7mm medium point is perfect for my needs, offering a nice balance between precision and boldness. The ink flows seamlessly onto the paper, allowing for a consistent and clean line every time.  One of the standout features of these gel pens is the exceptional quality of the ink. The rich, black color is deeply pigmented, ensuring that my notes and markings are always clear and legible. Even after extended periods of use, the ink doesn't fade or smudge, maintaining its vibrant appearance.  In addition to their outstanding performance, these gel pens are incredibly durable. I've been using the same set for months, and they show no signs of wear or drying out. The caps fit snugly, preventing any accidental drying or leaking, which is a common issue with lesser pens.  Another aspect that I appreciate is the sleek and comfortable design of these pens. They fit perfectly in my hand, allowing for extended writing sessions without any fatigue or discomfort. The sturdy barrel and rubberized grip ensure a secure hold, preventing any slipping or cramping.  Overall, the SHARPIE S-Gel Gel Pens have exceeded my expectations in every way. They are the perfect tool for any professional setting, delivering exceptional performance, durability, and comfort. Whether you're taking notes in meetings, editing documents, or signing contracts, these gel pens will become your go-to choice.

,B00MRH9NCK,R3PKC2KR1CNXZI,5.0,"My passionate and not-at-all-dramatic complaint is that I lovingly selected and ordered the PURPLE mattress protector, but received one that is by absolutely NO stretch of the imagination purple. It's not even lavender. Or periwinkle. Or purple-y grey. It's GREY grey. Not 50 shades of grey, just boring old cement grey. 🥺 And I cannot emphasize enough how much I was looking forward to the beautiful, dark purple mattress cover that would never be visible except between sheet changes. This may seem an unreasonable reaction to some of you cruel and heartless readers, but you see... even when I could not see my beloved purple cover, I would still KNOW it was purple, and that purple-y reassurance would be a ray of light piercing my dismal, colorless existence. But this much-anticipated happiness was TORN from me by whichever stock person thought it was clever to slap that Totally-A-Purple-Matress-Protector sticker onto a Very Obviously Grey mattress protector package. And so, by this lazy person's hand, my dreams of sweet purple pleasure met a bitter end. 💔  Nonetheless, I'll admit this mattress cover has a few redeeming qualities, despite its tragic lack of purple hue... For instance, it fits comfortably and snugly around my very thick mattress + mattress topper combo. It even has plenty of space to spare, should your mattress be even better endowed than mine. And - despite this cover's offensively grey tone - it properly protects my dear mattress from all fluids that threaten to do it harm. It doesn't even crinkle or make any other unpleasant noises when laid on, nor does it reek of chemicals when first removed from the packaging. (Would the purple one have smelled nicer, still? I suppose we'll never know... 😢)  In summary - This is an excellent matress protector. I bought this Should-Have-Been-Purple one + a black queen size one (which did indeed turn out to be black, lol) and I'm quite happy with both. That doesn't mean I won't carry my grudge about the color of this mattress cover to the grave, though. 😂 Alas, if only I weren't too lazy to send this one back and exchange it for an Actually Purple mattress protector. *dramatic sigh*  If you made it this far, you clearly need a hobby. 😂",

,B0C8C2NZMQ,R3QRRJVRFRM8HM,2.0,"DONT BUY THIS : - This tablet was purchased as a gift for my 4 yr old granddaughter.. in October was given at Christmas only used for 5 months by a 4 yr old. ..it now won’t allow for any changes to the storage. So once it’s full it’s full and you can’t delete anything. It won’t let me remove any apps and I’ve tried multiple times, using multiple different tutorials on YouTube to try and remove stuff with no luck. I went on the parents profile even and tried everything I could and it does not let you delete a single thing. So I finally tried to buy a SD card because if I can’t remove anything maybe I can free up space so stuff can at least update. But even after formatting it different 3 times, and trying to “move apps” more times than I can count and NOTHING transfers, I finally googled what the issue might be and I found a forum from someone who got a direct quote from Amazon saying some apps don’t allow to be saved onto an SD card and have to be internally stored. Basically telling me I spent my money on an SD card for nothing. And so now I have this tablet that is completely full, nothing is saving or will move to the SD card and a lot of apps she can’t even use because they need to update and can’t because there’s not enough room to update. and absolutely no where to get help for this. UPDATE 3 hours on with AMAZON CS who by the way knows NOTHING about the difference between a GUARANTEE and an WARRANTY...was a total waste. HORRIBLE CUSTOMER SERVICE 7 time i had to call back. WORTHLESS its unreal that some of the people who work there have NO idea what CS is truly about. Talking over me and cutting me off does not make them right. THEY are issuing a refund WITH a restocking fee for their WORTHLESS produce that has a GUARENTEE of 2 years. BEWARE DONT buy this",

I always buy the Sharpie brand because they seem to last longer than the generics and the tips seem to be more firm and not get all mushroomed. The generic ones are cheaper but I found that for how much longer the Sharpie brand lasts and how much more resilient it is, I get a better deal just sticking with the name brand on these. The Milwaukee branded ones are a close second, and almost indistinguishable from the Sharpie ones, and they are probably made by the same company because their price is about the same with the only difference being the diameter of the tip.

,B0BPSGJN7T,R3T103SY2L3E0R,5.0,"I've been researching an appropriate VPN router for a while, and finally settled on this little beast. It was mainly for travel but to ve very honest it is yet to leave the house.... because it serves as a the main household shield without sacrificing speed and connectivity. It is very easy to setup with excellent support and I have only powered it down once since I got it. Amazing dashboard/ Interface. You can use it as a route, repeater or mobile hotspot. An excellent feature is that it supports wire guard.. and many other features... that are just excellent added features.... The only con is that the there is only one LAN ethernet connection and you can MOST DEF LIVE WITH IT... and yet I still have 17 devices connected to it :)",

I also love that the case has the fold out handle that can be used for him to grip the device easier or prop it up somewhere. Battery life is also great!  A few things that I wish could be updated: you can't view an app on the device to get a description before downloading - when you click on it, it just immediately downloads. Also there isn't a way that I have been able to find to block certain YouTube channels or videos. Because of this, we download videos or shows we are okay with him watching and then switch the device to airplane mode so that he cannot watch ones that we haven't downloaded.",

,B000PGE032,R4666CVWCLBIF,1.0,"REVIEW FOR THE CUTTER ECLIPSE ZONE MOSQUITO REPELLENT DEVICE Let me first say I dislike when companies put more than one very different product on their listing. It combines all the reviews for the various items into one place, which makes it incredibly difficult to find the reviews for the one product you are interested in.  In spite of it being difficult to find reviews specific to the ECLIPSE ZONE MOSQUITO REPELLENT DEVICE, I went ahead with the purchase. I really wanted this to work. It seemed like the best, most economical option.  Sadly, the item I received looked used. As in someone purchased it, used it, didn't like it, and returned it. Then it was sold to me for the brand new price.  The warning sticker on the outside of the unit was peeling off. It appeared to have been removed and then replaced, but the adhesive was no longer holding it in place.  Also, the repellent bottle was less than half full. Certainly not up to the level shown in the product photos.  Despite that, I wanted this thing to work, and figured if it did, the sticker and low fluid would be a small price to pay in exchange for a working mosquito repellant. Except it didn't work. Mosquitos continued to buzz around me and the so-called repellent device, inches away from it. The instructions say to allow 10 minutes for effectiveness. I gave it close to half an hour each, two evenings in a row, before they chased me inside and I gave up.  What does work is my 20 year old bottle of Avon Skin So Soft. I was trying to avoid using sprays every time I wanted to sit out on my deck, but if that is what works, that's what I'll do. This thing was a waste of money.",

I was reluctant to trial multiple different devices to try to find a faster device, but saw a few mentions of good rates in the reviews for the MT3000 so thought worst case I would return it. Performance is 300MBit/s and I am extremely happy with it. Had no trouble getting both WireGuard and OpenVPN working with my VPN provider and got similar performance with both. I have it set up as wired connection to my router for WAN and then both a wired client and multiple wireless clients tunneling through the VPN. A bit more expensive than what I was hoping but given the cheaper models simply don't have the performance I guess you get what you pay for. Couldn't be happier.",

My second model worked well up until a few weeks ago when the hose attaches to the body of the container broke and I would need to replace the whole body unit to fix it, so I bought a new Shark since it could not be fixed. This new one works well and feels a little bit heavier than my older models. I like the lift away feature so I can use it to clean the carpet on my steps. I have a lot of the accessories and I save them from all three of my Shark vacuums and they fit all of the models. The only negative about the Shark is when I take the hose attachment off to vacuum under my bed, the vacuume sometimes tips over and that is what caused the broken hose part to break on my older one.

Moreover, the security tint gives me peace of mind knowing that my sensitive documents are protected from prying eyes during transit. The added layer of privacy is invaluable, especially when sending important paperwork or confidential information.  The envelopes are of excellent quality, sturdy enough to withstand the rigors of postal handling. I appreciate the attention to detail in their design, from the crisp, professional appearance to the reliable seal that ensures contents stay secure until they reach their destination.

Now that we're coming into rodeo season I decided it was time for my to buy a mattress for the trailer. My husband, as loving as he is, wanted me to buy an air mattress. I have enough back problems as it is so there is NO WAY I was going to buy an air mattress. He couldn't complain when I told him I found this one for $83 so I ordered it and gave it a try. It arrived 3 days sooner than estimated and was easy to unpack and unroll. I let it sit and ""puff up"" for a few hours (not as long as recommended because I'm impatient). I could not believe how great it felt! First rodeo isn't until next weekend so I can't attest to how a full night's sleep will be but the nap I took on it just for quality control purposes and it was fantastic!

This year it is very clear that the new quality “standard” has gone down hill, the filling is far less than what it was and I’m paying almost double for less of a pillow.

,B007VBXB48,R9MH7GGRYKUBA,3.0,"The pros: The lamination sheets are so thick it's very fast and easy to insert pages into the sheets. Once laminated it's very thick. The cons: If you need to cut things within your laminated sheet, even just the edges to make it regular paper size, or if you wish to use a round edge cutter on your laminated pages, the lamimation tends to come apart. I did not have this issue with a thinner (3 mil) lamination paper that I used to use, which was also cheaper. It was harder to insert my pages into those sheets prior to laminating, however, the lamination stayed together very well and didn't come apart when rounding edges or cutting it. I will be going back to my cheaper brand. I laminate a ton, being a home school teacher and a primary aged children's leader at my church. I need something I can depend on, that will stay together when I cut it or when I round the edges so they're not sharp, and this doesn't meet that goal.

I wish I had upgraded to this router sooner! Exceptional speed and coverage throughout my 2800 sq ft home. No need for wifi extenders, even in the backyard! Super easy setup, which was my biggest concern, since I had over 20 devices connected to my previous router.

Not sure if they use wrt’s gui or their own, but it’s super easy and flexible to setup the router. Far different from the days of DD-Wrt. You do NOT need to be a techie to set this up.

,B08412PTS8,RBXVHWV79X0JL,1.0,"HP printers and ink are absolutely the reason I refuse to purchase HP products. Their focus is 100% on recurring revenue, and because of that, their product quality suffers. This Envy printer I was given uses the 67XL cartridges, and while setting it up, I was pestered countless times to subscribe to their print supplies service. I print as infrequently as possible because inkjet printers are some of the biggest money-sucks that exist, so I declined the subscription prompt every time and came here to buy a couple of cartridges. When I finally had enough things I needed to print, I pulled the ink out of the package, popped it in, and got maybe 10 or 12 clean pages out of it in the following month before it stopped working.  The HP Smart app that you're required to use did absolutely nothing to help, even with its level 1 and 2 cleaning cycles; and even though the app shows the ""estimated ink level"" to be almost completely full, that cartridge is barely outputting any ink. At about 2 bucks a page, I'd say the cartridge isn't very cost effective. I guess if I would have just subscribed to their printer supplies program, I'd have another ready to go and wouldn't care that I only got 12 pages out of it. Between that and blocking out third party ink cartridges, I'd say they're pretty much forcing people into their printer subscriptions.  I wouldn't recommend this product or anything else HP makes.",

I was able to contact a customer service representative who was able to understand the product did not work and I had ordered a second one. Fortunately, I did not open the second one. I told him my situation. Because I think I had not opened the second one he said he would give me a refund. I really appreciate customer service of Amazon. I shop here a lot and will continue to do so.  I don’t know why the hummingbirds would not come to the feeder, but they did not and that’s the fact of the matter.

Canon is obviously not under the same impression. This piece of junk does nothing but eat paper and jam. If it was labelled as a ""Paper Shredder"" or ""Paperweight"" I wouldn't feel so cheated.

With Wireguard VPN (and OpenVPN) built-in, one can bring in one's own configs or use those of other providers. Excellent gain and transmission on 2.4 and 5GHz. There's an excellent, deep level of granularity and customization available, even though you might not need to use it. It's good to know it's there and works great too.  Use the Luci admin panel for open-source custom router rom, it's easy, and browse the 1000s of apps one can install, including DNSCrypt and DOH and lots of adblocking. It has its own admin interface too. It's almost like also having a Pihole in the same wifi unit. I'm thinking of tying in a whole series of LAN devices into it not just for travel to have uniform adblocking and encryption throughout. Be sure to make backups as you go along, because as with advanced features, it's possible for errors to arise. It can also be a plug in and go box, without getting into all its features.  The tech support is excellent, with help built in to the admin panels, and documentation on the website. Chat and phone is also available.  5 out of 5 stars, all around. Great price too.",

I plugged it in and a few minutes after it being plugged in I start smelling this burning odor coming from my laptop. When I looked down and realize that the only place it could be coming from was the power port I pulled it out and smelled it and it fried my port and hence rendered my computer inoperable as it can no longer be charged.

,B08438H4GM,RIBDROMPGH3TX,1.0,"Read the fine print with this thing. If you want it to output power through the dock’s built-in cable that you use to connect the dock to your laptop/tablet/etc., you need to have a 60 watt minimum charger/power supply feeding in to the dock. So you know the Thunderbolt 3 power supply that comes with your MacBook? It’s only 30w. So unlike basically every other USB-C dock, you can’t just use your laptop’s power supply, plug it into the dock and then plug the dock into that machine. You’ll likely need to buy a separate 60w charger just to power this dock.  Where does that extra power go? Beats me, because you don’t get power from the USB-A ports. So you can’t charge *anything* other than the connected laptop via this dock. *The USB-A ports do not send power.* Also, every time your computer display goes to sleep, HDMI-connected monitors disconnect. So if you’re inactive for a little bit and your display turns off, you will need to physically unhook the dock and reconnect it for the external monitor to reactivate.  I tried to contact Belkin tech support. Chat support can’t help you, because they’ll let you know that they’re not trained to support the docks — you have to call. I tried calling for hours only to get disconnected and hung up on literally every time I tried to enter menu selections. I went back to chat support to try to get help even reaching the correct support people, and I finally got a workaround via that route and was able to reach a human. But ultimately the support person I talked to wasn’t able to do anything for me, because this dock is as bad as it seems.  You are truly better off getting one of those no-name $30 USB-C docks. Yes, you sacrifice Thunderbolt 3 speed, but I’ve had a much better experience with connected monitors, charging USB-A devices, and otherwise *doing the things you’d expect a dock to do* for about 1/5th of the price — and in a much more travel resilient body, as well. As soon as I submit this review, I’ll be ordering one of those.  UPDATE: As claimed, I ordered a $30 USB-C dock immediately after posting this review. I’m so much happier with the cheaper item. Save yourself the money and the trouble.",

Then over twenty crawling over our window sill and in the sink. I prefer to use ""all natural"" items but nothing we tried was working. Vinegar was the only thing that slowed them down for a couple of days then they returned in twice the numbers. I researched a lot of products and brands before choosing this one and I have no regrets. It makes a small footprint in our home and it's administered in such a way that our cats can't get into it. After reading the reviews, I decided to use scissors to cut the tab off rather than try to twist it off. We set one trap on the window sill near where we saw the ants and one other trap on the countertop near the window. We put the traps out on Monday evening and by Tuesday evening not an ant was to be seen. We are going to leave the traps out for the 3 months they are supposed to last but will move them to less conspicuous places in the kitchen. We are very pleased with the fast response from these traps and will purchase them again if needed.",

,B09N72FMH5,RL9KNEZK2DFFD,1.0,"I needed a Wi-Fi WAN / repeater router, and OpenWRT software looked like it would do what I needed. I looked at compatible hardware for OpenWRT firmware, but instead of reflashing a ""big-name product"", I decided to go with the GL.SFT1200 Opal from GL-iNet since it is designed and shipped with OpenWRT firmware. It was easy to set up and verify functionality, doing what I needed initially. But after an hour or two connected to a strong Wi-Fi AP, the connection would drop and remain down for an hour or more before coming back up. This continued for several cycles until it finally remained disconnected. Seems like the radios in the product are a bit sketchy. I replaced with a Peplink Surf Soho router that supports Wi-Fi WAN out of the box, and it is rock solid with the same location and same AP. Good price point on the GL-SFT1200 if it works for you. Maybe mine just had a QA problem with the radio. But working in a remote location without the ability to power-cycle it when it disconnects, I need something more dependable.",

However, it says once it is set up via 2.4 then 5G can be used to print. I cannot confirm this. Nowhere did it say any of this in the description. I was only made aware via paperwork provided in the box. It took me 4 different attempts/locations/combinations of the above to get mine to work... It does not say Hotspots can be used to print and there are no instructions on how to do so. I had to contact HP Support. Even then they tried to tell me I needed Wifi. You do not. You can print via your Hotspot, if you made it through the hair-pulling process of initial setup. The printer has to be in WIFI-DIRECT mode to print via Hotspot.

Chops everything from onions to herbs in one push as long as you keep the thickness reasonable. I found I had to hand wash the metal chopper ""grids"" and the plastic pusher plate. Stuff gets down in and doesn't come out in the dishwasher. That's not a complaint; just an observation.  Unfortunately, my example was not durable, and I don't think I was too demanding at one or two uses per week. The ""basin"", the lid and the chopper blade inserts - yes. The hinges and clips that make the whole thing work - not at all. I don't know where the clip that keeps the blade assembly in place went - by the 2nd or 3rd use, it was gone. The spring/hinge assembly at the back is super weak. One side fell out after a month or so. and I had to keep putting it back in every use. The other side crapped out last night - the pieces snapping in half and the spring ricocheting across the kitchen to become an instant kitten toy (it's under the fridge now).  Worked well while it lasted, but it didn't last very long. I won't replace it - as designed/manufactured, the same thing will happen again,",

,B09BG6DSBY,RPMBIVGV0CCPO,1.0,"If I’d known it would be this difficult I would have purchased a different tablet device. I got this tablet thinking it would be a good option for my 5 year old for educational apps, games, videos, etc. It is not. Amazon has their own kids experience, which is content Amazon deems is for kids. There is way too much non-educational content to filter through. Then to make matters worse you have to delete everything you don’t want INDIVIDUALLY. You literally have to click on it, delete it, then go to next content you don’t want. It is 2024 how does functionality regress. Why is there no option to just get rid of all non educational content? If I don’t want my child watching Peppa or Bluey or content that has no educational value I should be able to search for that content and get rid of all of it, but no I have to click each individual video or game/app, or book which is tedious and stupid. Whoever established that user interface to work this way should be FIRED!!! This should be easy for parents but they have made this a parents nightmare as there is just way too much content they claim is kids content to filter through. Which makes me think that Amazon did this because they know parents will not want to filter through all the content, resulting in some parents to say skip it, which allows all the bs content for our kids to stay on the tablet. With the parent none the wiser. I called support and they told me “yes, ma’am you would have to delete the content one by one” and that he would escalate my feedback. So now I’m thinking of returning this just because of the hassle of removing content. I might as well get another tablet which better suits my educational needs and wants. I would not recommend this to a parent who only wants educational content on their child’s tablet. It will be hell removing and deleting all the content one by one. But if you don’t care about your child, about what they watch or are consuming I think this is the perfect tablet for you.",

As someone who frequently ships items for both personal and business use, having a reliable and durable packing tape is essential, and let me tell you, this one does not disappoint.  First and foremost, let's talk about strength. The Scotch Heavy Duty Shipping Packing Tape is incredibly strong and durable, providing a secure and long-lasting seal for all my packages. Whether I'm sending a small parcel or a large box, I can trust that this tape will hold everything together with ease, giving me peace of mind knowing that my items will arrive safely at their destination.  But strength isn't the only thing this packing tape has going for it – the clarity is equally impressive. The clear tape blends seamlessly with any packaging material, providing a professional and polished finish to my packages. Plus, the 1.88-inch width ensures ample coverage, allowing me to seal boxes quickly and efficiently without worrying about gaps or overlaps.  Another standout feature is the ease of use. The tape dispenses smoothly and evenly from the roll, with minimal effort required to tear it off. Plus, the adhesive is strong enough to hold securely, but also allows for easy repositioning if needed – no more struggling with tape that sticks to itself or tears unevenly.  The value for money is also worth mentioning. With a generous length of 54.6 yards per roll, this packing tape offers excellent value compared to other brands on the market. Plus, the twin pack ensures that I always have a backup roll on hand when I need it most, eliminating the need for frequent reordering.  In conclusion, Scotch Heavy Duty Shipping Packing Tape is a must-have for anyone in need of reliable and durable packaging solutions.

And last, when i ask the company hp to return my printer because of many issues, they wouldn’t even tho my printer is still under warranty. I spend 3 hours with somebody trying to get my issues fixed for nothing.  So save your time and money. Buy another printer.

Now he walks out of his room every morning and the first thing he does is check this calendar. It's super easy to update and keep synced from my phone and computer.

And suddenly my MacBook battery life started to go done and suddenly when I plugged the charger in it sparked and stopped working.

The original Toshiba power cord adapter was recalled by Dynabook (they bought Toshiba Computer). The Toshiba adapter cord is a fire hazard and why it was recalled. The delivery time for a replacement is 3-4 weeks but I had to send them a photo of the adapter with the cord CUT before they would start the process to send a new adapter to me. I needed to work on the computer during that time so I bought this adapter cord to use during that time and when I get the replacement from Dynabook, I will have a spare one.

,B08L1QFBFB,RW2PT8SLYUQXK,3.0,"I'm used to Cricut stickers with no seam and how they can be a little bit of a pain to peel, but these are way worse than that. I've peeled and stuck 6 of these, and 5 of them split into ripped paper on the first try. One of them was almost irredeemable until I finally got a lucky fingernail into the adhesive layer. Also I can tell that several of the stickers use (uncredited) fan art, one was even a Star Wars mashup. Very much feels like a pile of art the seller ripped from a ""Fallout 4"" Google Image search. Also the color and print quality aren't the best. I'm not saying I expected the seller to have checked with Bethesda, but it's clear the seller has no regard for Fallout OR sticker-making, and just wanted to create an ""impulse buy"" item.",

But, after I decided to cut ties with cable and rely on streaming services for TV instead, I found I needed to strengthen the Wi-Fi signals throughout my 2-story condo if I wanted to watch TV everywhere. I already was using eero as my router, and decided to gamble on just adding this extender and hoping their promises of easy set-up were correct. To my amazement, they were! I read the few sentences of installation procedures, plugged in the extender, and within minutes I had a strong enough Wi-Fi signal to watch TV throughout my condo, upstairs and downstairs.

,B009QYH52C,RWDAKFCL3K2PZ,5.0,The pen writes nice and erases very easily. I don't know about the longevity of the pen because we haven't used it long enough to know.,
,B099Z8HLHT,RWDLB7U8HXFP3,4.0,"I love my Kindle Fire, for the most part. I’ve had several, and if mine were to need replaced, I’d probably still choose another Fire over the other Kindle options, just for versatility. The Fire is compatible with the Libby library app, which is great, as you download books from Libby through your library directly to your Fire. The backlighting makes it easy to read at night or in bed, and it’s easy to use to watch TV. It’s not as versatile as a dedicated tablet like an iPad, but if you’re wanting it mostly for reading, with a few extras, it’s a great choice and really affordable, even compared to other Kindles. The only downside, for me at least, is that the Fire is quite heavy compared to a Paperwhite. Not a big deal, since I like the other features I get with it, but it’s comparable in weight to a hardcover epic fantasy if you put a case on it, so heavier than other Kindles and heavier than most paperback books as well. Without a case it’s slightly lighter, but I rarely don’t use a case with it. It’s also a bit hard to use a pop socket with it to make holding it a little more comfortable, but might work better with an adhesive strap on the back instead. Battery life is okay - it’s more of a tablet than other Kindles so it’s got more power being used on the lighting for the screen, which means it does die faster and need charged more often. If you’re reading for an hour or more every day, you’ll probably need to charge it every 3-5 days. It’s definitely not one of the Kindles that can go 3 weeks without being charged, which is fine by me since I can do more with it than I can with other Kindles. Picture quality is just okay - it’s not bad, but again, it’s not a high-end tablet. It’s an e-reader with some tablet functionality. If you’re looking for something that you’re wanting to watch TV or videos on a lot and care about picture quality, you’ll want something more high-end that’s meant to be more of a tablet. Overall, perfect for what I use it for!",

I bought it based on a Buzzfeed rec, and within a day, my neighbor called my landlord while I was at work, worried that there was burning plastic in my apartment. She was right—it kind of smells like a diaper that has been burning in a vat of Axe body spray, with an inexplicable undertone of backed up sewage. Weeks later and it isn’t any better. I had to pour the liquid down the drain. Huge waste of money—I think maybe the seller replaced the essential oil that was supposed to be in there with, like, a bargain bin version of Febreeze.",

,B0BW41H1W2,RYLX1O0V2B0YS,5.0,I received a Microsoft Surface from someone in an IT dept that was taken out of service…I didn’t have a charger for it so I figured I would give a 3rd party brand a try. So far so good…no complaints here. I just wish the cable that connects to the wall and to the brick was longer - it’s about 24” and I don’t see why they couldn’t make it 4’…. because how often do people complain about a charger being too long for their laptops…,

This one needs improvement to make it better.",

I bought the TP-Link AX1800 WiFi 6 Router (Archer AX21) – Dual Band Wireless Internet Router hoping that it would work, that the Wi-Fi 6 was compatible, and that I did not need to be a genius to replace the old modem with this product. I have to admit that it was pretty easy to install. What I did not realize is that I would have to change the network setting on all four of my televisions, reset 4 smart plugs and 2 smart switches. Both iPhones had to be switched to the newly named and installed network as well as my wireless printer. Overall, I am very pleased and happy to have a new and more versatile modem for our home.",

,B08PKDLBZ3,RZHYP10VMG7WW,1.0,"I purchased this charger in January'24 after checking the details & reviews ( both good and bad ones). However more recent reviews are true. 1. This charger is not reliable aka its not charging the device properly ( it shows charging but my laptop kept shutting down abruptly while working and then on restart it showed 1% battery). I got my battery tested by Apple and there is no problem with it which made me question the charger's performance. 2. The led light on the charger is not stable. Although my laptop is charging , the light is not orange/ at 100% battery its not green sometimes. 3. Overheating issues which is weird . This makes me question this product's build quality. Sadly i cannot return this product and its a part of tech junk for me now as i need to replace with a new charger. Final Result : Buy at your own risk. Not a good purchase and can damage your device potentially due to all the over-heating and incorrect functioning issues.",

This just isn't worth it I'm sorry to say. I hope more companies utilize the roller ball for the clip, but I can't justify purchasing this again sadly.",
,B072FVQNWM,RZJJ6V0P2PHYM,2.0,"I ordered two reams which I'm using for printed brochures which when folded in half are 8.5"" x 11"" in size. The first ream had no problems. As I began folding sheets from the second ream I started having extremely frustrating issues with the creases. After lining up the width edges and folding down the crease I would experience drastic warping, crinkling, and bunching. After testing a few blank sheets it's become clear to me that the bottom (length) edges do line up, but reveal a massive cutting error from the manufacturing process. 2 stars because one ream was delivered as advertised",
