"Amazon Fire HD 8 tablet, 8” HD Display, 32 GB, 30% faster processor, designed for portable entertainment, (2022 release), Bla",B099Z8HLHT,https://www.amazon.com/All-new-Fire-HD-8-tablet/dp/B099Z8HLHT/ref=zg_bs_g_pc_d_sccl_1/138-0555187-5805649?psc=1,4.4,14822,$64.99 ,Amazon Devices,2102313011.0,"Rating: 2, Review: Don't catch on to calendar...can't figure it out
Rating: 1, Review: I bought this thinking it would be a good way to store my 18GB of music files and play them offline, maybe check email, Facebook etc. Tried to set up Gmail and it would not allow the authentication of the product to take place. Kept saying unauthorized. Google this, it's a common issue with no real resolution, no way to troubleshoot, it just does not work on this device. Seems like a fight between Google and Amazon. Ok, I didn't really want the email so let me try something else. I loaded up OneDrive where my MP3s are stored and told it to synch the music directory. It thinks there's nothing to sync but It did not work, no reason why, no way to troubleshoot, no files found in file explorer. The software simply doesn't work on this device. Ok, I try connecting to USB and manage to copy the Music directory onto the device. I can see them in File Explorer. Amazon Music does not see them or recognize them at all, even adding a custom directory and pointing it to my music had no effect. Ok, I try another program suggestion called VLC. It doesn't see them either but they are all there and I can add one song at a time to a playlist and it will play but I have over 4000 songs so adding one at a time is impossible. The option to add all in a folder doesn't work either. NOTHING WORKS ON THIS TABLET. It's not particularly responsive with some black screen pauses in between clicks makes you thing it crashed but it's just slow. It might be OK when using the Kindle app but don't expect it to do anything else. A complete waste of my money.
Rating: 5, Review: I was looking at a older model when this latest model popped up for the same price. I was thrilled to get it. I read constantly and for the past few weeks I have had to use my phone. I just can't do without a Kindle.
Rating: 2, Review: I got this as an alternative to mounting a tv on my wall. Now I’ve got to buy another dang iPad because this thing is so useless. Wont stay connected, even when it is sitting directly next to its provider. Volume: if you want to be able to hear it, you’ll only be able to use it in summer with air conditioning off, otherwise you’ll never hear it, even while leaning over it. You can’t use Patreon. You can’t access any of your apple items, which even google lets you do. The MOST hilarious part? The streaming app that has the least chance of working if it ever does connect? You guessed it- Prime Video. Seriously, just get the iPad.
Rating: 1, Review: I bought this for my parents to replace a very old iPad. They don’t use it for much - mostly just to play internet radio and occasionally read the news or look at Facebook. So I figured they didn’t need an expensive tablet. This one has been extremely disappointing. The speaker on it is absolutely awful - it barely projects any sound. It also has a timeout feature so the music has to be started again every 15 min. I wish I hadn’t purchased it and had sprung for something better. I’m outside the return window so we are stuck with it. Ended up buying a speaker to go with it and I’ll keep reading forums on how to fix the time out - doesn’t seem promising as there are a ton of people complaining about the same issue with no fix.
Rating: 5, Review: It is fast and serves my needs.I highly recommend it.A great value for the money.
Rating: 3, Review: Having had 3 Kindles before, this one just does not cut the mustard. Music playlists pause a lot when playing. You also have to navigate through through their ""get prime music "" when you are going through YOUR OWN MUSIC !. To get to your book library takes almost as much time as the Kindle 7. This one needs improvement to make it better.
Rating: 1, Review: It's very slow, practically unusable for anything other than surfing the web. Even at the $59 price I bought it at, it's just an expensive paperweight for me now.
Rating: 3, Review: I use it for sermon notes and church. Helps me not get distracted by other apps like my phone.
Rating: 3, Review: This tablet seems slower than my old Kindle and locks up on me alot.
Rating: 5, Review: Love these things. I've purchased 8 as gifts. And I have never heard a complaint.
Rating: 1, Review: Only works for about 4 months. Do not buy this.
Rating: 5, Review: I bought this for my 94 year old mother and it’s perfect for her. Long battery life, easy for her to hold and the sound is great.
Rating: 4, Review: I love my Kindle Fire, for the most part. I’ve had several, and if mine were to need replaced, I’d probably still choose another Fire over the other Kindle options, just for versatility. The Fire is compatible with the Libby library app, which is great, as you download books from Libby through your library directly to your Fire. The backlighting makes it easy to read at night or in bed, and it’s easy to use to watch TV. It’s not as versatile as a dedicated tablet like an iPad, but if you’re wanting it mostly for reading, with a few extras, it’s a great choice and really affordable, even compared to other Kindles. The only downside, for me at least, is that the Fire is quite heavy compared to a Paperwhite. Not a big deal, since I like the other features I get with it, but it’s comparable in weight to a hardcover epic fantasy if you put a case on it, so heavier than other Kindles and heavier than most paperback books as well. Without a case it’s slightly lighter, but I rarely don’t use a case with it. It’s also a bit hard to use a pop socket with it to make holding it a little more comfortable, but might work better with an adhesive strap on the back instead. Battery life is okay - it’s more of a tablet than other Kindles so it’s got more power being used on the lighting for the screen, which means it does die faster and need charged more often. If you’re reading for an hour or more every day, you’ll probably need to charge it every 3-5 days. It’s definitely not one of the Kindles that can go 3 weeks without being charged, which is fine by me since I can do more with it than I can with other Kindles. Picture quality is just okay - it’s not bad, but again, it’s not a high-end tablet. It’s an e-reader with some tablet functionality. If you’re looking for something that you’re wanting to watch TV or videos on a lot and care about picture quality, you’ll want something more high-end that’s meant to be more of a tablet. Overall, perfect for what I use it for!
Rating: 5, Review: The advances made by Amazon with this product through the years is honestly amazing! It’s fast, easy to use, great battery life and the ability to expand the memory is something not done by the most expensive coughapplecough products. I recommend my Amazon devices to all that ask.
Rating: 5, Review: So far everything has been perfect.
Rating: 2, Review: I bought this for my granddaughter. It was kind of running slower than it should have, but I figured it might be our internet since we live in the country. I bought a protective case and all. Four months later it doesn't even work. There's NO damage, it just stopped working and for $100 this is very disappointing.
Rating: 5, Review: I bought this for my grandson to be able to play his games and do his learning ability programs on there. I love it better this way he doesn’t have to use the telephone. It works great and I recommend this
Rating: 5, Review: Great battery life. Great color on screen. Would buy again.
Rating: 4, Review: I like the fire - it does as much as my laptop. It's smaller which is great for traveling.

It really is a great product. The only thing that has bothered me about the device is its limited access to the Android platform which really hampers my use of the device for me but it is an Amazon product with its own platform that is moving farther away from Google.
Rating: 3, Review: Faster roll response. But fire is too brand-specific which limits user’s options!
Rating: 5, Review: 7 years makes a different. Faster, great screen. I like the Amazon world but still wished for more apps. But you can't beat any Fire tablet for the price, bought on sale and traded in my 2017 for $30. Also have previous 8"" HD. Thie is much nicer. I use it to read newspapers. Also have latest iPad. Pretty comparable except apps.
Rating: 5, Review: Very happy with my pad. Great picture, good sound quality, nice size

Rating: 5, Review: I am able to search for favorite TV shows &watch them when I choose to. So my viewing options have expanded a lot!
Rating: 2, Review: Very disappointed in the pictures taken with the camera. Have tried to work with on several occasions and have never been able to take a decent photo. Pictures are blurry even when I sit it on a table, unable to bring the item in closer. It has been sitting in a drawer and not being used for much of anything.
Rating: 3, Review: I wanted a replacement of the product not a credit. Please assist
Rating: 5, Review: This tablet is easy to set up and easy to use. Very happy with the his tablet.
Rating: 5, Review: I use this tablet for a lot of things. But it plays my arpg game really well. I'm playing Eternium. I just beat trial level 118. Not many are this far. I'm #10. This game requires a lot to run. It runs well. I am amazed how well hd10 works.Its great for everything else too. I almost never write reviews. I just had to this time
Rating: 5, Review: It’s a vast improvement over the previous Fire HD tablet that we owned. Hopefully, it will continue to receive updates well into the future unlike its predecessor.
Rating: 5, Review: Bought this for my older father. He absolutely loves it. Screen is big enough for him to read the apps easily. Set up was a breeze with Amazon account.
Rating: 1, Review: 1. Adverts required unless I pay NOT to get them? 2. Doesn't recognise my bluetooth keyboard/case! 3. Forces me to log in with my Amazon account instead of my choice 4. Assigned me a kindle account which will never be used 5. Continues to populate my screen with annoying clickbait for movies and shows I can't see! (Visually impaired) 6. Annoys me every @#&$ time I log into my account with a STUPID email I'm going to return it to factory settings and see how well it works without bluetooth. 😖
Rating: 4, Review: Got this as a replacement after an accident shattered the screen on my previous gen tablet. Display looks very nice, but the performance and speed seems slower than my previous Fire tablet. Perhaps this is a software issue that will be taken care of in an upcoming update.
Rating: 5, Review: My grandson was very happy with it. Special going up from the kids to this.
Rating: 2, Review: This thing sucks. I had a fire 10 9th generation that worked great for a few years. It started to get slow so I decided to upgrade. Now I have issues downloading movies from Netflix and Disney. The sound can get loud but speaker placement sucks. Screen looks good so no complaints there. The crazy part is at the point I’m considering just using my old one a little longer and hope that maybe some updates resolve these issues.
Rating: 1, Review: Just try getting help to fix auto downloads from happening. Not possible. Once you own the product customer service throws you off to the side. Meanwhile, downloads keep downloading. BS.
Rating: 2, Review: This is my 3rd Fire tablet. I will never buy one again. It freezes all the time. I have to reboot daily. Do yourself a favor. Get an iPad. I did and it is 100% more reliable.

I wish I bought my daughter an iPad instead.
Rating: 1, Review: This is the most non user friebdly tablet I've ever used. Not to mention, the storage is a huge problem. The necessary systems take up most of the storage space so I constantly need to delete apps and clear the cache for my kid to play something else.  Now it just gives us error messages and won't let anything download. I would have been better off getting a regular tablet through another brand.
Rating: 1, Review: Bought the 16GB model. ""The system"" takes up 7.6GB just to run. When I look under storage, it says I am using 9.98GB of 10.88GB. Where's the other 6GBs? No room to install apps. Waste of money.

Rating: 3, Review: so my kid went from an Ipad (because the screen is shattered) to this android. definitely mid because it’s android so I already knew it wasn’t the best. Some apps/videos crash. The screen gets frozen sometimes to where I have to restart it. It does the job with Netflix & Disney. Someone said there was kids YouTube, definitely lied. There’s regular YouTube but I was looking more for the kids YT. I say this was worth 30$ for a 2 year old. Don’t feel like returning it so it’s okay.
Rating: 4, Review: Had a hard time at first the sound was terrible. Finally got it figured out. Granddaughter loves it.
Rating: 5, Review: Durable, lasts long, many options. Very enjoyable and entertaining.

Rating: 1, Review: El artículo es muy caro y vino defectuoso, no hay quien de la cara para solucionarlo, TOTALMENTE MOLESTA!!!
Rating: 4, Review: This is what I describe as a ""chill laptop"". It's the reliable, ageless device you park next to your couch and cruise the inter webs on, the computer that transitions to a DJ machine for a party, the one you grab when you need to do some serious professional work. It does it all, it's snappy and the battery life makes you wonder why you ever had to charge a laptop before. Did I mention there isn't any fan noise? It's fantastic.  All of the basics are covered on top of that, speakers are great, keyboard is great, screen is great. This is how Apple makes great devices, by nailing the basics. Mac OS feels limited, but ultimately is a just an adjustment period if you're coming from windows. Most apps and programs work, but make sure before you buy this laptop, as MacOS tends to have some extra hoops to jump through. You can game but it entirely depends what game you're playing and if it's compatible. This is the biggest thing, you need to be slightly tech savvy to get Windows and apps running. Apple wants you to use their apps, which are greatly optimized.  The only real negative is the notch, if it bothers you and the soldered components that are non-upgradeable. I'm not going to get into debates on how much RAM you need but I've never needed more than 8gb for years now and never experience slow down. I also only live in 3 - 5 browser tabs and close down programs I'm not using. If you're cruising the web and using basic apps this computer will easily last you 4 - 5 years and be better than anything on the market. Not to mention the awesome resale value of Macs.

Hey Apple, why on earth is battery replacement so expensive when you've already charged a fortune for the item itself?

Rating: 5, Review: I am absolutely blown away by the Fire Max 11 tablet – it's everything I could have hoped for and more! The stunning 11-inch display delivers vibrant colors and crisp detail, making it perfect for streaming movies, playing games, and reading e-books. The performance is lightning-fast thanks to the powerful processor, ensuring smooth multitasking and lag-free gaming. I'm also impressed by the battery life – even with heavy usage, I can go a full day without needing to recharge.

Rating: 5, Review: I got this kindle 11 to replace my kindle 10. The kindle 11 is much faster than my old kindle. Also it's much more sensitive to touch. I replace my old kindle 10 since I got tired of constantly resetting it to factory settings. It feels a little bit lighter than my previous kindle and setting it up was a breeze. I just received this yesterday and very pleased with it so far.

Rating: 4, Review: When it was time to upgrade my Fire Tablet, I decided to treat myself to the ""top of the line"", newest model. I upgraded to the Max Fire 11"" tablet. It's pretty big. In retrospect, I wished I would have gotten the smaller size, as my main use is for reading.  At the time, there was a great deal on the bundle that included the keyboard and stylus. I ended up returning BOTH of those items within 2 days. I could not find a reason to have the stylus and the keyboard was clumsy. It worked fine, but it added to the bulk of the device.  **I don't believe the battery life is as long as the Fire Tablet I replaced.***

The crazy part is at the point I’m considering just using my old one a little longer and hope that maybe some updates resolve these issues.

Rating: 5, Review: Not being very tech savvy, I was worried about the potential complexities of installation - but the phone app (via Q-code) walked me right through the process. I just a matter of minutes (maybe ten?), I was up and running. The signal is strong, and the speed made my old router look like a model T compared to a Ferrari. Very, very happy with the results. Multiple devices operating simultaneously with zero noticeable lag on any of them.
Rating: 5, Review: My Centurylink modem that I owned lost the 5G signal for wi-fi. I bought the TP-Link AX1800 WiFi 6 Router (Archer AX21) – Dual Band Wireless Internet Router hoping that it would work, that the Wi-Fi 6 was compatible, and that I did not need to be a genius to replace the old modem with this product. I have to admit that it was pretty easy to install. What I did not realize is that I would have to change the network setting on all four of my televisions, reset 4 smart plugs and 2 smart switches. Both iPhones had to be switched to the newly named and installed network as well as my wireless printer. Overall, I am very pleased and happy to have a new and more versatile modem for our home.
Rating: 5, Review: Replaced my old router and this one was simple to set up. It works well.
Rating: 4, Review: This was supposed to be delivered to me on the 2nd, I just received it today, but that's not why I'm complaining. I did some research and came to find out that I have been living with throttled internet speeds for years due to false advertisements on my old router manufacturer's part. I was only getting about 12MB a second when I should have been getting over 90MB. I'm pretty angry at myself for not catching this sooner, but at any rate, that is what drove me to buy this product. It is stated to be able to handle about 574mbps, and my plan is only for 500. From the reviews and the price, especially with the price being slashed, I decided to go for it despite never hearing of the brand before. The router itself is fine and has some nice tech and features. What is terrible, however, is the phone app Tether they tell you to download to set it up. I don't know if this app is 3rd party, but if it is, they need to get away as fast as possible. I created my account, set my local account password, did the usual phone things like 2-factor auth and fingerprint access. This all originated from using the routers default password of course. I then created my wifi password, which is separate. I did all this through the phone app, got the confirmation email, opened it and clicked the button to authorize, and yay my account was created. It reset and put me back at the local password login. Ok, no problem, I just set that. Type it in. Incorrect. Delete it, show password, type it in again just to make sure I had no errors. No dice. I try my router password, no dice. I try the default password on the router itself, no dice. I'm about to get locked out at this point. The only options are to ""Forget Password?"" or contact customer service. I try forget password, ""Please hold the reset button on the router for 10 seconds to restore to default settings."" Well, guess that's the only way. So I do. Hold it for 20 just to be safe. Let the router do its thing. Try again with the app. Set my passwords up again and it looks like I'm connected. When I'm done going through the motions again, it sends me back to the main login, yet again, for the same screen I just created another password for. I type it in. No good. Try again, no good. Try the router password, the default password, nothing. There's an option to connect to it anyway so I try it. It appears my phone and computer are on the network with full bars, but there's not actually an outside internet connection. I'd been messing with this for about an hour at this point so I was getting frustrated. I decide to reset it again, held it for 30 seconds just to be sure, and it just sat there with a single solid light. I unplug the thing after this for 60 seconds. I plug it back in and my PC finally has internet again, at least enough to get to their website. (Hardwired btw for the PC) So I decide to take the second approach suggested in the instructions and set it up online. Flawless. Actually remembered all of the passwords I created and gave me several more options and screens than the phone application did. I can finally log all the devices in my house onto the network. I just tested my download speed and I went from 12MB to about 80MB with that particular platform. So, to summarize, the product works, just don't use the janky phone app at all.

Rating: 3, Review: This is a wonderful tablet for kids however I really dislike the fact that I have to link my Amazon account and this gives my child access to my photos and videos. I didn't realize this was a thing until my child deleted several pictures from my album thinking he was making space for data on his tablet. I searched the internet and Q&As on Amazon and finally reached out to Amazon to try and remove the access and was told that there was no way to restrict access to my childs tablet so it is pretty frustrating.
Rating: 1, Review: We bought these tablets about a year ago, and the longer we have them, the more I hate them. The biggest issue is that you cannot use prime video on the kids profile. Like, what?? You can only share movies, shows, or books that you have purchased. So anything that you can download to the parent’s profile is not available on the kids profile. It’s so dumb. Not to mention they are slow and adding any sort of app to the kids profile is a pain. Before a big trip I go through and make sure everything is downloaded, and because it’s so slow, it takes me well over an hour for 3 tablets. We’re cheap so we’ll continue to suffer through until they die but we are not purchasing them again.
Rating: 1, Review: Didn't realize the front facing camera didn't work until after the return window. Can't refund or switch the product. Amazon's ""trouble shooting "" has nothing on it, and other tech forums have no fix for it. Save your money for a tablet that works.
Rating: 2, Review: I love the fire tablets for my kid - I love the control I can have over content and screen time limits, and it's so easy to set up! However, when I got the fire 8 to replace my daughter's old fire tablet that was ready to retire, I was incredibly disappointed with how slow this version is!  Trying to use the tablet is an exercise in patience for me as an adult, much less my 9 year old. It will even give problems just trying to change the brightness level.  Overall I'm disappointed and honestly debating returning it and getting a different brand, and finding an app I can use for parental controls instead, because this is ridiculous.

Rating: 2, Review: I wish we had gotta different tablet. These are incredibly slow. A full 2 minutes to buffer up. You click on a game and can count 10 Mississippis before it opens and loads. Which for a toddler and you g kid can be very aggravating. I purchased these for a 12 hour road trip. They were incredibly hard to set up. Also, even though we have a restriction set from 6am to 8pm with a three hour limit during that time. Sometimes it glitches and just allows my daughter to keep playing. We've doubled checked the restrictions and it's properly set. It's just a malfunction of the tablet. Also, every time we open my daughter's tablet it goes to my personal Amazon home page and then we have to manually go into kids. Honestly, I wish we had gotten a different kind of tablet. But it's past the time to return and I needed them for my trip. Battery life is good. Save yourself the trouble get a different brand.

Rating: 2, Review: Write down all passwords and pins. Because you CAN NOT RESET YOUR PASSWORD WITHOUT WIFI. You can't fix problems with wifi from the kids side. Creating a paradox that you can't get in without a password to fix the wifi you need to reset the password. I just have spent some time online trying to figure it out. Basically I have to factory reset and start from scratch. Thanks Amazon, good one, I am not happy about spending this time to reset. And my daughter is going to be upset that everything is gone, and she has to start from scratch. Super security there amazon, I can't even get in my own devices. I really wish I could say this is my only problem, but in 4 months there have been a few issues.
Rating: 1, Review: If I’d known it would be this difficult I would have purchased a different tablet device. I got this tablet thinking it would be a good option for my 5 year old for educational apps, games, videos, etc. It is not. Amazon has their own kids experience, which is content Amazon deems is for kids. There is way too much non-educational content to filter through. Then to make matters worse you have to delete everything you don’t want INDIVIDUALLY. You literally have to click on it, delete it, then go to next content you don’t want. It is 2024 how does functionality regress. Why is there no option to just get rid of all non educational content? If I don’t want my child watching Peppa or Bluey or content that has no educational value I should be able to search for that content and get rid of all of it, but no I have to click each individual video or game/app, or book which is tedious and stupid. Whoever established that user interface to work this way should be FIRED!!! This should be easy for parents but they have made this a parents nightmare as there is just way too much content they claim is kids content to filter through. Which makes me think that Amazon did this because they know parents will not want to filter through all the content, resulting in some parents to say skip it, which allows all the bs content for our kids to stay on the tablet. With the parent none the wiser. I called support and they told me “yes, ma’am you would have to delete the content one by one” and that he would escalate my feedback. So now I’m thinking of returning this just because of the hassle of removing content. I might as well get another tablet which better suits my educational needs and wants. I would not recommend this to a parent who only wants educational content on their child’s tablet. It will be hell removing and deleting all the content one by one. But if you don’t care about your child, about what they watch or are consuming I think this is the perfect tablet for you.

Rating: 2, Review: We had an older fire tablet for my son that just wasn’t working very well and since this was on sale we thought we’d buy a newer + pro version to get better performance. Unfortunately this is just not good enough for kids. It is an extremely frustrating experience to download games, subscribe to games via a child profile (e.g. Paw Patrol Rescue World), get YouTube kids and stay signed in (constantly logged out and have to go through the very annoying login process), and the performance of the tablet is just not good enough. Sometimes it’s fine but too many times you’ll experience sluggish UI, apps locking up, or just buttons taking forever to do what they’re supposed to do. This is not a good quality device.

She can still turn on the tablet, but it has lines all through it. I have a 2-year warranty. Don't know how to get it replaced.
Rating: 2, Review: Not value for the money
Rating: 5, Review: My toddler is a busy body. She was never into TV and is super active. I bought this to help because we now have a newborn. This keeps her busy and out of trouble while im feeding the little one. I love the parental controls plus the control of the screen time.
Rating: 5, Review: Bought this for my son to use on a flight to Hawaii. It works perfect and we even use it to keep him occupied while at restaurants. I bought a memory card for more space to hold movies. It keeps a good charge. We may charge it once a month. I use a set of Bluetooth speakers to connect to it for the sound but it also has decent speakers. You can connect all your streaming apps and use offline mode. Would definitely buy again.
Rating: 4, Review: We do like it for my two-year-old and four-year-old each have one, however. We have got to figure out how the settings work and it’s just a little complicated. It’s linked to your adult Amazon account so you keep having to go back-and-forth for things. We just have to spend time trying to figure it out. I wish it was automatic. Or I can do more with settings on the tablet. Maybe I just haven’t figured it out yet.
Rating: 5, Review: Easily programmable with parent controls. Wonderful results and provides great controlled quiet time. What a pleasure watching my 4 year old grandchild’s reaction and pleasure playing Roblox.
Rating: 4, Review: Really good for the price. And my baby loves it.
Rating: 5, Review: The best investment for traveling with grandson. Keeps occupied and entertained in the same
Rating: 5, Review: I bought this when it was on sale. The best thing I could have gifted ""myself."" It allows my husband and I to go out to restaurants again ever since we had our daughter. She is 2.5 and it keeps her engaged for the duration of our meal. Great parental controls.
Rating: 5, Review: Bought this for my toddler. Absolutely perfect in every aspect. At two years old and change he’s flipping and zipping through the function and applications he likes as good as anyone can. Truly amazing.
Rating: 5, Review: I absolutely love this tablet. All other kids tablets lag after a couple weeks of using but this is the best brand to get. My daughter loves it and the case it comes with is super sturdy. She has threw it and with the case on it doesn’t hurt the tablet at all it just bounces off the floor. With Amazon you can use the parent dash board to control everything they do on there.
Rating: 5, Review: Love it for my grandkids
Rating: 2, Review: I like and dislike these. They are incredibly slow. Takes about 2 minutes to open and load. They were incredibly hard to set up and half the time don't follow the restrictions and times set. We have ours set from 6am to 8pm but sometimes it glitches and my daughter can play it outside of those time frames. We've doubled checked the restrictions and it clearly says it on there but it just messes up sometimes. The only thing that has made this purchase worth it is it comes with one free year subscription with educational games and videos. Honestly, if we hadn't needed these for a 12 hour road trip I would have returned them and got something else. Save your self the headache get a different brand.
Rating: 5, Review: 👍
Rating: 2, Review: If you want to download things from google play, or even take advantage of your YouTube premium to download videos to watch offline, look elsewhere. This has some nice features that can be great in the right circumstances, but it’s not for me and my kid. Slap on top of that unintuitive processes to give kids access, inability to know what can be power to the kids profile (like prime video downloads can’t be used in the kids profile), and terrible performance of the tablet itself, I can’t recommend it.  A tablet shouldn’t be built so much for kids that parents can’t do anything to make it work the way they want.
Rating: 5, Review: My 3yr old son got this for Christmas and uses it every now and then to find different games to play. It's durable and withstand his rough play. Fast when you don't let them download everything, so keep an eye or limit the downloads for fast non stop gaming.
Rating: 2, Review: This was very difficult to set up and for my child to use. Switching back-and-forth between parent account and child account was very confusing and not intuitive. The interface was slow and clunky. Also, it was not possible to set up YouTube kids on this device. Wish I had saved myself the money and just bought an iPad.
Rating: 2, Review: The media could not be loaded. While we can use bluetooth headphones and a C adapter to plug in headphones, the actual headphone port does not seem to work. I would like to request a replacement and according to Amazon I can do that but something is wrong with the site or the app because it keeps just giving me suggestions to help but nothing has to do with the port on the headphones not working.

Rating: 5, Review: This is a great tablet, it works really well for my 7 year old! I like that I can control a lot of what it can do, such as parental controls. It had a fast charger and stays charged for a couple days. It's also very durable. I really like this tablet.

It really is a great product. The only thing that has bothered me about the device is its limited access to the Android platform which really hampers my use of the device for me but it is an Amazon product with its own platform that is moving farther away from Google.
Rating: 3, Review: Faster roll response. But fire is too brand-specific which limits user’s options!
Rating: 5, Review: 7 years makes a different. Faster, great screen. I like the Amazon world but still wished for more apps. But you can't beat any Fire tablet for the price, bought on sale and traded in my 2017 for $30. Also have previous 8"" HD. Thie is much nicer. I use it to read newspapers. Also have latest iPad. Pretty comparable except apps.

Rating: 4, Review: Got this as a replacement after an accident shattered the screen on my previous gen tablet. Display looks very nice, but the performance and speed seems slower than my previous Fire tablet. Perhaps this is a software issue that will be taken care of in an upcoming update.

Rating: 2, Review: This thing sucks. I had a fire 10 9th generation that worked great for a few years. It started to get slow so I decided to upgrade. Now I have issues downloading movies from Netflix and Disney. The sound can get loud but speaker placement sucks. Screen looks good so no complaints there. The crazy part is at the point I’m considering just using my old one a little longer and hope that maybe some updates resolve these issues.
Rating: 1, Review: Just try getting help to fix auto downloads from happening. Not possible. Once you own the product customer service throws you off to the side. Meanwhile, downloads keep downloading. BS.

It was very disappointing. Will reorder.
Rating: 5, Review: It was a easy to set this up to build my mesh network off my Starlink gateway as it was to set up my Starlink. Every Starlink owner knows exactly what I am talking. Connect the wires. Connect the power. Wait. Done. Of course there were some configuration steps to type in my SSID and create my password, but this was wonderfully effortless and easy. I have over 4800 square of space. Every corner is covered and I still have one Deco unit out of 3 to deploy if I find some area needs a boost. I think I might hang on to it for outdoor entertaining in case I find a weak spot later.

Rating: 5, Review: In about 15 minutes I had them working with excellent Wifi Speed.
Rating: 5, Review: I had wired backhauls on my old Deco S4 system but it would run at 10-20 mbps almost slower than wireless. After hookingt his up, the wired backhauls work properly and I'm getting 300+ mbps everywhere.
Rating: 5, Review: I finally decided to replace my cobbled up wifi network with a mesh network. My existing network consisted of a wireless router and two TPLink extenders which worked OK most of the time except that I was constantly dealing with having to reconnect / rediscover my audio streaming devices (WiiM units). The challenge with my configuration is that the house is very long, over 150 feet, 4500 sq ft, and single story, which was my reason for moving to a mesh network. Setup was easy via the app and I was able to keep my existing SSID and password for the network making it easy to transition all my existing devices to the new network with no reprogramming. Download speeds at all locations in the house are great. I have Cox 100 Mb service and I see very little degradation anywhere in the house. And the issues I had with unreliable connections to my audio streaming devices appear to be resolved. Using my tuneblade app on my PC, both devices now consistently show up via the app. If you are looking for value and performance the Deco X55 is the answer.
Rating: 5, Review: Very pleased with the Deco. I was able to plug it into our Starlink router and get up-and-running within 15 minutes. Now the entire house including upstairs has great dl/ul speeds.
Rating: 5, Review: Works good, easy to install.

Rating: 2, Review: Product setup was easy. But you’re not getting the full product by paying for it. Most of the features are hidden behind a subscription based paywall. Look elsewhere if you want full use of your home network.
Rating: 5, Review: Works really well. Replaces a Netgear Nighthawk which was running 720 mbPS by the router but dropping to 180 mbps 3 rooms away. Using the Mesh - am at 440 mbps in that room as well as upstairs. Should have done this a while ago!

Rating: 5, Review: There is only about 10 percent mbps loss from the base units to each of the satellite units. This is despite being on different floors and having to penetrate dense horsehair and plaster walls. Haven't buffered even once in the 2 months plus since installing. Less than 10 minutes to setup. A rare product that works exactly as advertised!

Rating: 5, Review: I purchased an earlier model of the TP-Link Deco Mesh System in 2021, because I had a lot of buffering and freezing on my bedroom TV. Although the WiFi had improved, the problem was still frequent. Adding another Disk on my bedroom was. Improvement, but it didn’t eliminate the problem.  I recently purchased the AX3000 (X55) Deco Mesh System is designed to penetrate brick cement, walls, floors and multi-leveled spaces. I called Deco Tech Support and model replacement process was smooth and easy, and the connection was quick! What a difference a “Deco AX3000” makes! There is absolutely no buffering or freezing and the picture quality is sharper and clearer. I highly recommend this model if you experienced the problems I’ve had.

Rating: 5, Review: I bought this as a replacement for another charger that I bought, which was very loose, and I was happy to find that this charger fit, snug, didn’t overheat, and charged rather quickly. The part where you plug it into the wall is very sturdy and when you plug it in it doesn’t wiggle around at all. High-quality.

The first charger was also not recognizing so the company sent a replacement however, this one is no longer recognized by my computer.

You get a great signal for gaming and watching movies online at the same time on multiple devices! Perfect for fiber internet!
Rating: 1, Review: I added these 6+ because customer service told me I would get a boost despite having eero pros on the network. Since then download speeds and upload speeds have been as low as I have ever seen and they show almost full bars on the app. If you have a very large house I don’t recommend. The home I’m in is about 10,000 sqft and I have plenty of EERO’s in the house to get proper coverage. They tell me to reduce the amount of EERO’s have online, but nothing connects if I follow their instructions. I spent hours on the phone and with the EERO’s moving them and reconfiguring. It’s been nothing but a disaster of time and money. If you have a smaller home I would recommend this product. Big house find something more expensive and better than an eero system. I’m very disappointed.
Rating: 5, Review: Was able to replace 6 Linkesys by 4 Eeros… no more problems and great coverage!
Rating: 5, Review: Pros: Excellent performance Easy to install and manage Controls home automation devices Supports 160MHz channels Cons: Pricey Lacks USB connectivity Some features require a subscription
Rating: 2, Review: What a gigantic waste of time I switched out my existing setup to go with this setup. One thing is is that it's full-time 5g, there's no 2.4, they have a part where you can drop down to 2.4 to connect devices but the problem is it always defaults back up to worked terribly with my with lights and with Alexa 5G and then your devices get confused. Worked terribly with my Wiz smart lights and Alexa. Crappy part is now I have to reconnect my old set up.
Rating: 3, Review: I absolutely hate paywalls! Items are already expensive and now they want you to pay a monthly fee to be able to use parental controls and go more in depth with network data usage. The VPN and Protecting you better from phishing and virus isn't a must have when it comes to networking.  I would have been even more P'd if I paid for the top tier 7 and it had a paywall.  It's my own fault to not doing more research on the app rather basing my decision on the performance reviews.  It has been one of the easiest setup, the range is decent, and so far it's doing what I need it to do.  They put parental control behind the paywall to force you to pay the monthly or yearly fee. Ridiculous, eero brand and other brands need to be avoided if parental control isn't included. I have adult children so I don't have the need for this feature, but come on.  Hardware is, app, and setup are 5 stars.  The paywall for parental control and network data are 1 star and in my opinion very deceptive.
Rating: 5, Review: It was very easy to replace the older model of Eero with the new one using the app. All devices are working as before without any interruption

Rating: 1, Review: 5/10/2024 Update I added another extender ($85.00), so I am literally less than 10 feet from the extender (which is less than 15' from the main router) and my download speeds are STILL below 25MBps (on an internet connection that is over 300MBps). GARBAGE. AVOID. My Orbi was an unstable system, but way better than this junk. Unfortunately, I threw away the box and I can't return it.  ORIGINAL This mesh system is supposed to cover 4500 SF??? My house is about 1500 SF, and the coverage is terrible. My desk is in the back bedroom, 22' from one satellite (wood walls, not metal...) and 27' from another and I get 1.85 MBps download! Setting up was very problematic, also. AND, I had to switch all my partner's Alexa devices to MY account (which was also a huge pain in the butt) because they have to be under the same account to work correctly. I replaced an Orbi system because it was so unreliable, not thrilled with EERO 6+ either.
Rating: 1, Review: I typically refrain from giving negative reviews, but purchasing the eero mesh system was the worst decision I've ever made. I've had it for over six months now, and ever since I hooked up this mesh system, I've been having trouble connecting to the internet. Initially, it occurred once or twice a month, but now it's happening every day. I contacted customer support, and after some diagnosis, they advised me to perform a soft reset, which seemed to work for about a month. Upon encountering the issue again, I reached out to customer service once more. They instructed me to conduct a ping test while the network was down to determine if the problem lay with the internet provider. Subsequently, they suggested replacing the Ethernet cable to ascertain if that was the culprit. I used the same Ethernet cable that came with the eero system. In that case, I told them they should provide me with a new cable, but they didn't respond to that.

We put it in garage, connection has been perfect for the garage and upstairs above the garage. Easy to install. Directions are simple. Recommended!
Rating: 5, Review: When I got my EERO router when I switched internet plan, the signal was not very good. It was slow and I had problems staying connected. This is because when I first had internet (and cable) installed in my house (a long time ago), they decided to install the connections on one side of the house. I tend to be on the other side of the house most of the time.  I couldn't take it anymore and so broke down and spent the $80 for this extender. It was easy to setup and my connection is really good now. It definitely works!

Rating: 5, Review: The EERO 6 extender provides a strong reliable signal to an area the main router didn't reach very well.
Rating: 5, Review: This unit immediately resolved inconsistent and weak WiFi issues we were experiencing in one of these of our home. Had we obtained it from our cable provider, it would have cost $10 per month indefinitely. Also, it was extremely easy to install. Just plug it in and wait a few minutes.

Rating: 5, Review: I picked up an eero Mesh Extender to boost the Wi-Fi for my outdoor Ring cameras, which had spotty reception due to the thick brick walls of my house. Setup was a breeze and the difference was night and day. The Wi-Fi now reaches areas it never did before, giving full signal strength to my cameras and great connectivity outside. This extender is a lifesaver for anyone with dead spots at home. Highly recommend it!

Rating: 1, Review: The auto updates are frequent and I’m getting tired of having to reset all my 2.4 devices to get them back on the mesh system. You will find this very annoying.
Rating: 3, Review: These do work however they are very picky about placement in our house to get a good signal repeated to devices. Overall I can say they work better than other wifi device I've purchased in the past. We will most likely add more devices and functionality in our house as the Eros system grows.

Rating: 5, Review: We have Frontier Fiberoptic as our provider and the technician gave us eero 6 for a router. It really made a difference in speed (Wifi 6) but signal got extremely faded with some distance. I was going to set up another router as a way point or buy cheaper extender due to its price. However, now I am happy with the purchase. There is no weak area or dead zone in our house (about 2000sf), and the signal reliability is great.

Rating: 5, Review: As a non-technical person, I was a little reluctant to mess with my Wi-Fi. But, after I decided to cut ties with cable and rely on streaming services for TV instead, I found I needed to strengthen the Wi-Fi signals throughout my 2-story condo if I wanted to watch TV everywhere. I already was using eero as my router, and decided to gamble on just adding this extender and hoping their promises of easy set-up were correct. To my amazement, they were! I read the few sentences of installation procedures, plugged in the extender, and within minutes I had a strong enough Wi-Fi signal to watch TV throughout my condo, upstairs and downstairs. Wonderful product!

Rating: 1, Review: This charger stopped charging after about two weeks of use. Similar to when a phone charging cord eventually meets the end of it's life cycle and you have to get it in just the right orientation for it to charge, the same thing happens with this charger. I have to mess around with the cord and block forever just to get it to charge my laptop and sometimes I just get fed up and stop trying. Seems like that shouldn't happen after I just bought the product. Would recommend you look elsewhere, I'm already looking for a replacement. Also I've seen sparks come out of the power strip when plugging and unplugging this charger. Can't say for sure it's the charger and not the power strip but I haven't noticed that from any other chargers being plugged into it.

Rating: 1, Review: I bought this charger for my 2015 MacBook Air. While I will say my MacBook is older and has held out for me for about the last nine or so years since I purchased it, buying this charger, almost burnt down my apartment.  About a week ago, I was trying to charge my MacBook and everything was fine until one day when I went to plug it in and smelled a burning plastic smell. I Initially thought it was because my computer was old and the battery, but after using a actual MacBook Air Charger From the manufacturer (apple), My computer was working fine and was not experiencing those issues. I I would just spend the extra dollars for the on-brand MacBook charger because it created a ton of stress when I needed my computer and couldn’t use it for employment opportunities. I understand that not everyone has money to spend, but this is one instance where I would say spending the money. It’s definitely worthwhile. I will likely never buy another generic charger again. For those wandering, I bought this product in January 2024 and it was the middle of April 2024 when it stopped working.

Rating: 5, Review: We had the 2022 Kids Tablet and had issues with it from day one. Worked with Tech support to get a refund and then ordered this model. Vast improvement in performance, stability and battery life over the last years model. We took this with us on a flight to Hawaii and our son watched movies and played games the whole way without any crashes, lags or battery issues. The protective case is thinner which works well for our 8 year old son that wasn't enjoy the thick padding of his old tablet (though it was an amazing protective case). The new thinner style for older kids still provides a lot of protection while giving him better hand grip. Great Tablet and I would absolutely recommend picking it up for your child.

Rating: 1, Review: Well, I needed a new router as the one for Speculum was blocking a program I need to use, which needs Internet connection to function. Anyway, I had an old Zyxel one which seems to have died, despite hardly ever being used & siting in a cool dry closet for the last several yrs.  At any rate, I refuse to pay $100+ for a router or a modem, which is sadly the case for most these days for what reasons, I don't know! So, I looked through what Newegg & Amazon had to offer, & for what was w/in my reasonable price range-under $50! & this one seemed to get great reviews, although I am confused as to how that happened, cause this thing is a useless piece of crap!!🧐🙄😒 I have NEVER had so much difficulty trying to config a router in my nearly 30 yrs of experience w/both computers & networking! I wasted a grand total of over 8 hrs on this thing, & STILL never got it setup! It should take a max of 30 mins to do so!  & I need to set a static IP address for the aforementioned prog I needed to get this router for, & everytime I set it, & then hit SAVE, the damn thing timed out, & gave me an error code. I called their USELESS incompetent tech support, & the 'genius' I spoke to there didn't know what the error code even meant! 🤦‍♂️ She said I had to call back later to speak someone who actually knows what they are doing! Not her exact words, but roughly translated from tardo to English, that is what she was saying!🧐 I was exhausted from being up all night, & crashed, & when I woke up several hrs later, I tried in vain yet again! I even DL'd & installed the latest firmware update for it-this had literally NO EFFECT whatsoever on the problem, BTW!🙄😒 & now, it can't even load the settings page at all for this thing, regardless of what IP address you type into the address bar in the webbrowser!🤬 & their useless 'tech support' just basically told me to call my ISP to have them walk me through this problem! Claiming they couldn't help me set a static IP address in it! Not that it even matters when I cannot even get into the router's settings page!🙄😒 & BTW, Speculum refused to give me the static IP address info too!. It's literally just a set of #'s!🙄😒🤦‍♂️  At any rate, if Zyxel's current crop of routers weren't all $100+, I'd just buy one of theirs, as their tech support aren't incompetent, & they will actually help you, & their products aren't useless crap!  So, I am returning this paperweight, & will buy a diff 1 which is hopefully far better w/far better tech support, & not too expensive, & hopefully actually works w/out crashing everytime you save any settings changes you make, & doesn't fail to open up the IP address page for said settings on the thing too!!  BTW, I'd have given tech support 0 stars, but they won't allow you to!

The primary reason for my purchase was to find a reliable docking solution that could support two 4K displays in addition to the MacBook's built-in screen. This dock manages to do just that brilliantly.  Setting it up was straightforward; I connected one monitor via HDMI and the other through DisplayPort. Both screens work seamlessly, providing crisp and vibrant visuals without any lag or distortion. An added bonus is the dock's ability to charge my MacBook, which helps reduce cable clutter and keeps my workspace neat and organized.  Overall, if you're in the market for a dock that supports multiple high-resolution displays and offers the convenience of charging your MacBook, the Belkin dock is an excellent choice. Highly recommend for any MacBook Pro user looking to expand their display capabilities!
Rating: 1, Review: Bought it two months ago then it just up and stopped working. Not worth it at all
Rating: 2, Review: It just plain didn't work, straight out of the box. I tried putting two basic portable hard drives in at the same time, and it started overloading and making weird sounds. I spoke to customer service and they suggested maybe it can't handle that. I am just surprised - I had a cheap Plugable dock that was able to handle two hard drives much better, but of course that broke (for different reasons), but it lasted much longer than this Belkin.  Also for those who didn't know - the usb c port doesn't have charge/energy capability, so if I plugged a computer speaker that uses usb c for power, it couldn't handle that either. So the cheap Plugable one for $17 actually had more capabilities. I'm still figuring out some reasonable solutions that won't break in three weeks.
Rating: 1, Review: I have a MacBook Pro m1 and wanted to connect two external monitors in extended mode. It does work but the ethernet speed was only 500 Mbps instead of 900+ which all the cheap docks have given me. It's a good dock for Mac if you don't mind your internet being throttled.

Rating: 4, Review: I need, like, 3 more inches of cord to be able to have this to sit squarely under my laptop riser while also reaching the port and having a usb plugged into the back. It's just my setup, of course, but I remember reading before I bought it that other people said similar things and I have to agree. Otherwise, it works as intended. I can plug in all the peripherals that I need, plus an ethernet cable, into my on-the-left-two-port-only MacBook.

Rating: 1, Review: As advertised, this dock doesn't charge my macbook pro at 60W. When I contacted chat customer support they denied providing any support (although there is a separate section on belkin website which says ""Live chat For Phone Docks, Screen protectors, Chargers and Cables"". Very poor customer support. Never buying a belkin product again.
Rating: 5, Review: Brilliant Docking station for my MacBook Pro 16'', now I can connect it with only one cable. The only thing (and it's completely ok in my case) is Power Supply output is 60W, and my power supply input is 90W, so dock charging slower, but it's ok in my case.
Rating: 5, Review: I need to have 2 monitors plus a bunch of other stuff connected to my MacBook Pro. The laptop only has 2 lighting/usb-c ports. I had a similar one but it was a usb-c and I had all kinds of issues with the ports always having to reset them. Upon some research I discovered that even though these ports are usb-c compatible if you are going to be using a hub with a charging port the hub has to be a lighting bolt connection. Otherwise the power is not correct and causes huge problems. So far So good. I recommend this hub to anybody who needs more ports for more stuff.
Rating: 1, Review: It only works as an adapter. Whenever you plug the power cord into the adapter, nothing works, including the displayport. So only way to use it is by plugging 2 cables into my laptop.
Rating: 1, Review: Tried to connect the dock with just one monitor via HDMI and an external mouse via USB but it wasn't able to keep with the 65w power input of the power adapter. So essentially my MacBook gets discharged really fast whenever I try to connect it to the dock. Returning this right away.
Rating: 1, Review: Does not work with Lenovo Yoga laptop.
Rating: 4, Review: In general, quite happy with it. No glitches during use of it. Biggest complaint is rediculously short laptop cable. No extra cable to provide any type of strain relief. Connection to laptop always seems kinked unless docking station is perfectly in line with laptop port. Also be advised that cables come out all 4 sides of this docking station, so make sure you have adequate desk space.

Rating: 5, Review: I was having problem with my MacBook and my 2 4k monitors, i decided to get this dock and it has been a game changer. No problem when the machine goes to sleep not with the flickering
Rating: 5, Review: So I've tried several different docks and this seems to be the best for my new MacBook Air M1. I wanted to write a review because everybody is reviewing for Pro's and the Air is different BECAUSE of the power adapter that comes with it. The Air comes with a 30 watt power adapter so when I would plug it in through the dock it would not charge. The work around is to get a 60 watt power adapter which is also still compatible with the Air. The issue is the dock uses some of the power and not all of the 30 watts goes through to the computer and what little that did go through the computer did not recognize as being enough to charge. The 60 watt is working great and don't worry, I did verify all of this with both Apple and Belkin tech support. I'm using one very large external monitor (this doesn't work with dual monitors on the M1...not a Belkin thing it's and apple thing) both USB ports for various things and the 3.5mm sound out to a mixer/speakers and the charger for the computer.  It is really convenient as I only have to plug in the one thing into the thunderbolt and everything is up and running. The cable is short but I use my computer as a second screen and have a raised docking station for it to be at eye level. I mounted this dock to the back of that stand in the upper left so the connector just literally loops around and in. Very happy so far and will update if that changes.
Rating: 1, Review: Read the fine print with this thing. If you want it to output power through the dock’s built-in cable that you use to connect the dock to your laptop/tablet/etc., you need to have a 60 watt minimum charger/power supply feeding in to the dock. So you know the Thunderbolt 3 power supply that comes with your MacBook? It’s only 30w. So unlike basically every other USB-C dock, you can’t just use your laptop’s power supply, plug it into the dock and then plug the dock into that machine. You’ll likely need to buy a separate 60w charger just to power this dock.  Where does that extra power go? Beats me, because you don’t get power from the USB-A ports. So you can’t charge *anything* other than the connected laptop via this dock. *The USB-A ports do not send power.* Also, every time your computer display goes to sleep, HDMI-connected monitors disconnect. So if you’re inactive for a little bit and your display turns off, you will need to physically unhook the dock and reconnect it for the external monitor to reactivate.  I tried to contact Belkin tech support. Chat support can’t help you, because they’ll let you know that they’re not trained to support the docks — you have to call. I tried calling for hours only to get disconnected and hung up on literally every time I tried to enter menu selections. I went back to chat support to try to get help even reaching the correct support people, and I finally got a workaround via that route and was able to reach a human. But ultimately the support person I talked to wasn’t able to do anything for me, because this dock is as bad as it seems.  You are truly better off getting one of those no-name $30 USB-C docks. Yes, you sacrifice Thunderbolt 3 speed, but I’ve had a much better experience with connected monitors, charging USB-A devices, and otherwise *doing the things you’d expect a dock to do* for about 1/5th of the price — and in a much more travel resilient body, as well. As soon as I submit this review, I’ll be ordering one of those.  UPDATE: As claimed, I ordered a $30 USB-C dock immediately after posting this review. I’m so much happier with the cheaper item. Save yourself the money and the trouble.
Rating: 1, Review: I think the latest OS patch (2019 Macbook Pro 13' 16gb) from mac bugged out the Thunderbolt 3. It can do everything still...just not at the same time. I have to feed my power cable directly into my laptop, instead of the dock, otherwise the unit won't extend the displays to the monitors. It's a weird bug and i hope software can fix it - soon.  9/13/21 - still no fix - can't recommend this product.
Rating: 3, Review: For some reason, using a HDMI to DVI cable does not work with this dock.  Also, anytime the dock gets bumped slightly, it loses connection
Rating: 1, Review: Got the device and it worked great. Made WFH life easier. Now, 10 months later both USB ports stopped working. It's a bummer.

It's supposed to be designed for a child, so one would think it would be easy to navigate. It is not. Little to nothing is self explanatory, and I feel like 95% of the screen is trying to get you to buy more and more and more. The battery life also leaves something to be desired. An iPad is definitely more money, but it's also definitely more easy to use. Overall, the case is the best feature, it does keep the device protected.
Rating: 1, Review: The tablet is so slow, and you have to touch it just perfectly to be able to go back or go home. I wish I bought my daughter an iPad instead.
Rating: 1, Review: This is the most non user friebdly tablet I've ever used. Not to mention, the storage is a huge problem. The necessary systems take up most of the storage space so I constantly need to delete apps and clear the cache for my kid to play something else.  Now it just gives us error messages and won't let anything download. I would have been better off getting a regular tablet through another brand.
Rating: 1, Review: Bought the 16GB model. ""The system"" takes up 7.6GB just to run. When I look under storage, it says I am using 9.98GB of 10.88GB. Where's the other 6GBs? No room to install apps. Waste of money.

Rating: 5, Review: I like everything I order and my niece love the iTablet
Rating: 3, Review: so my kid went from an Ipad (because the screen is shattered) to this android. definitely mid because it’s android so I already knew it wasn’t the best. Some apps/videos crash. The screen gets frozen sometimes to where I have to restart it. It does the job with Netflix & Disney. Someone said there was kids YouTube, definitely lied. There’s regular YouTube but I was looking more for the kids YT. I say this was worth 30$ for a 2 year old. Don’t feel like returning it so it’s okay.
Rating: 4, Review: Had a hard time at first the sound was terrible. Finally got it figured out. Granddaughter loves it.
Rating: 5, Review: Durable, lasts long, many options. Very enjoyable and entertaining.
Rating: 5, Review: Bought this for my five year old she loves it. My only complaint is I bought a memory card to go with it and it's hard to download more books and games on it. Also it's kind of a pain to control certain shows and games to play... Once you get it all figured out there's lots of educational stuff for it. Kids think they're just playing when it's actually teaching them.
Rating: 3, Review: The media could not be loaded. We got this less than a month ago and the speakers have blown and sounds crackly. We got the tablet for my toddler to watch Netflix. It was working fine but then today the speaker blew and now it sounds horrible. Other than that it is a great basic tablet, like I said we just use it for Netflix.
Rating: 2, Review: The product is durable, other than that it's not really usable for my 4 year old. We continuously get a low memory error despite having over 120gb free. The memory card is formatted as internal storage, nothing from the kids profile will save to it. Items from the adult profiles will, but I bought this specifically for my child.  I've gone through the customer service recommended actions and nothing will fix the problem, but I did find a thread of many other people having the same error.  I was not a fan of the kids+ subscription, I wish there was a way to only download the 5 apps I want my child to use. It's very overwhelming for a child. I had to deactivate it to do this. So now we have the subscription and tablet, but do not use it.  Save yourself the money and get a Samsung tablet with a good case.
Rating: 3, Review: I pretty much like the tablet but we got it for our girl mainly to watch her favorite YouTube Spanish educational videos however we can’t even watch them on the browser so it’s not helping us for what we need just for what the tablet offer! We will return it as soon as we are back from our trip

Rating: 4, Review: I use this table for reading books. However it's great for downloading movies to watch on a plane. It's easy to navigate the battery life is great. However, it's nearly invisible if your using it outdoors, especially on a sunny day. Great for indoor use or on a long flight.  I would recommend this device if you don't plan to use it outdoors.
Rating: 3, Review: The amazon store is terrible. Way too many missing apps. With the tablet based on android I can side load the applications I need, I would rather get them from the Amazon store but it is very very deficient.  The speed of the tablet is ok, not great, but ok. I can watch videos, and shop on amazon fairly easily. Screen is ok for what I need. Not fantastic but not bad. Battery life is decent.  If Amazon moves on from Android, I will not be purchasing any future tablets, the android software base is what makes it usable.
Rating: 5, Review: I'm 81 yrs young but struggle with reading post-eye surgery. This Kindle app is a huge improvement for reading from the10th gen I traded in. I started using the green backdrop with the old tablet, and with the more advanced features of my12th gen, I'm so happy! This new Fire also offers the green backdrop for Kindle. This version is also speedier and right in for glide word entry. So glad I ignored the naysayers!
Rating: 4, Review: I was looking to replace a 7"" tablet. I love the portability. This Amazon Fire HD 8 Plus tablet was such a good deal that I couldn't resist. The plus version gives you faster charging and slightly better performance. Surprisingly, it is still portable enough for my use. In fact, it feels a lot better in my hands to use in comparison to the 7"" or 10"" and larger tablets that I own. I bought it to use only a few specific apps. But I find myself reaching for it more often than my other tablets to read, for emails, browse internet, social media and games. It's just the perfect size for me. It has 32GB of storage, which is enough for me. The tablet charges very quickly and the battery lasts a couple of days. The screen is pretty bright, touchscreen works well. The cameras are decent, it would have been nice if the front camera was 1080p like the rear one. Since most people don't take pictures with tablets but may use them for video calls. The volume is sufficiently loud for watching videos and listening to music. It has a headphone jack. Beware, the cheaper version has ads on the lock screen. You can pay $15 more for an ad free device. . You are limited to the Fire OS, so make sure your apps are available in the Amazon app store. There are work arounds, if you know, you know. Of course, being an amazon prime member makes these devices even more useful. Overall, I think this is a great tablet, if it is not your only device.
Rating: 5, Review: Far exceeded my expectations. Thank you
Rating: 3, Review: Disappointed in the item. This the 3rd Kindle Fire i have had and the first with any major issues . instead of a attempted repair i would like a replacement because i have had to use the power many, many times trying get the device to open. It would open and close over and over. Repairing would be like getting a refurbished device since this one is just over a month of use.
Rating: 5, Review: The screen is bigger than my old Kindle Fire. Has much more memory. I love the holder that is also a charger that was available with the Fire HD. It has the ability to play games, has several “coloring” games included, and can use internet with it.

Rating: 1, Review: This is the second Fire Tablet that I have purchased that just stopped working. Both were only occasionally used for travel purposes and both failed because they weren't turned on for a couple of weeks. Amazon's quality control is terrible! Some have worked for years and others failed just after the warranty ends.
Rating: 5, Review: My fire 8 HD is exactly what I'm was looking for.
Rating: 1, Review: Recent update changed many things that make this fire unusable for reading as it was purchased for. Text to speach was replaced by assisted reader, which is terrible. You can no longer listen to books without constantly having to restart after timing out. There is no way to fix this in settings. It also no longer continues to read with the cover closed so it can be carried in a bag or backpack. Some of these changes were intentional, ie assistive reader...others appear to be programmers lack of testing and knowledge of how people use the tablet. I've owned several kindles. This will be my last. It's not the first time an update has completely destroyed the ability to use it as expected. It's really since Kindle unlimited and other book purchases are also useless.
Rating: 3, Review: I work at a TV station and we have a very rudimentary Fire app for our channel. The feed kept pausing. I have fast internet. It doesn't do that on my old phone's app nor online, so I can only assume it's the tablet.  It also offers 30 days of free Audible, yet the button to accept says 3 months. Get it together Amazon!

And, so I'm back, getting ready to pay a healthy amount so I can easily charge the beast - if I'd known, I'd have bought the cheaper beast. Obviously, 1st world problem, but, c'mon Amazon. ya know I luff you, but sneaky low blow.
Rating: 5, Review: Meets all my expectations
Rating: 5, Review: Having had the Fire HD 8 only, so satisfied that I went for more RAM with the Fire HD 8 Plus.. The comparative performance between these 2 machines is clear. Given my own electronic needs, I'm much more satisfied with the HDI 8's speed & video performance.
Rating: 5, Review: My primary use for my tablet is listening to stories, books. I use it at night and set a timer on the tablet so it cuts itself off. I also like being able to adjust the size of the fonts. It will also connect to my connect and my Bluetooth headphones making it possible for me to listen while I'm gardening. I don't come close to using my tablet to its full capacity but I wouldn't want to do without it.

Rating: 5, Review: As an accountant, I work with multiple excel documents, and I used multiple displays connected to laptop via HDMI and USB-c ports until very recently our company replaced HP laptops with Microsoft Surface laptops. Unlike my previous HP laptop, new surface laptop came with one usb-c port and one usb-a port, which was quite frustrating as I could connect only one external displays. Microsoft offers docking stations for surface laptops with the price starting at $200 which is quite expensive for my budget. After several days of searching for the right device, I decided to try Dell docking station, and I wasn't disappointed. It works perfectly for me, I can connect 3 external displays (1 in laptop's usb-c port, and 2 displays in the docking station, 1 port remains available) which is crucial for my work. The docking station also comes with multiple usb-a ports and 3.5mm audio port which is very convenient. As a warning, the device is not plug & play and not identified by windows on my laptop, I had to download a driver from Dell website. Also I am not sure if this docking station can be used for gaming, sometimes there are lagging issues with the image. Otherwise, I am very happy with this docking station.

Rating: 2, Review: As I mentioned it does not charge your laptop so look for the D6000 if you need a docking station that charges the laptop. The sneaky thing about this is that there is no mention of it in the description, OTHER than it being mentioned in the reviews. Totally not helpful.
Rating: 5, Review: Easy setup and works as expected for multiple displays
Rating: 3, Review: This docking station is OK but not great. When you connect the docking station cable to your laptop it will take some time before the screens would turn on. The biggest letdown is half of the internet speed (cabled internet) is gone when using the docking station. I am not a techie guy but this is my observation by comparing internet speed with the Ethernet cable plug to the docking station against plugging it directly to my laptop. I could be wrong, but let me know how to improve my internet speed when Ethernet cable is plug to the docking station.
Rating: 5, Review: Worked perfectly with my Dell 2-in-1 Laptop and UltraWide monitor setup. Very solid remote work setup.
Rating: 1, Review: Yes, this docking station will let you display 3 monitors and have ports for wireless keyboard and allows external speakers. BUT in 2024 what docking station doesn't allow you to charge your laptop with that same chord??? This is the first Dell docking station I could find that has the speaker port which is why I ordered them for our team. But I never would've imagined having to check to see if it charged as well. Our security team requires us to have Dell brand docking stations, which is great if Dell made one like all the other companies.  Dell please make a docking station that has 3 monitor capability, 2-3 usb ports, speaker and microphone ports AND charges your laptop, just like every other company has.

Great value for the money. Easy to use. My only issue is that the lights on the inside don’t turn off. Which isn’t a big issue at all just a mild annoyance. I’m not doing anything too heavy with my laptop but I can play magic the gathering on it now without it overheating (don’t get a MacBook if you’re reading this but if you already have this will help)
Rating: 2, Review: Fan worked flawlessly on days 1, 2, 3, 4. Did not run them on 5, 6. Would not turn on day 7. Checked the connections. Good. Everything has power. Except the fan switch. I was looking to a solution for a computer that runs too hot (IMO). While this unit was working it was fine. Better than other reviews would suggest (it cooled the computer very well). For lack of a working switch I find wallet lacking value (cash).
Rating: 2, Review: Barely cools my gaming laptop and doesn't only comes with only extra usb port
Rating: 5, Review: I play sims on my MAC and it runs so slow because it gets overheated after just 5 minutes of playing. When I use this, it doesn't overheat at all and my game runs great! I was worried about the light but its pretty subtle.
Rating: 5, Review: This cooling platform is the bomb, at least to me. I do a lot of G.IS., graphics and technical drawing. I have been through a few computers. This device has helped my current laptop to last beyond it expected life. It has soft blue lights for you to know the fans are on and is convenient enough to carry in my laptop bag. Its puts out about 52 decibels.
Rating: 1, Review: It did cool my HP laptop quite well for six weeks. Then one fan stopped working completely.
Rating: 5, Review: I know this is meant for gaming laptops, but I bought it for my everyday 17 inch screen laptop. I hadn't used cooling fans in a long time and remember when they were loud and noisy. This is quiet and has been running without issue since I bought it. It keeps my laptop cool and you can hardly hear the 3 fans. Would definitely buy again in the future.
Rating: 5, Review: Llegó en perfectas condiciones
Rating: 5, Review: So far, so good. The fan operates quietly. It seems like it is helping my laptop operate a bit cooler.
Rating: 2, Review: Bought this fan because my work laptop constantly overheated. It worked great and kept the laptop cool but 4 months in and the fan is LOUD. 30 dollars for the product to not last a year is not cool. I would advise against buying based solely on how long the fan worked for me.
Rating: 5, Review: I have a high end, new HP that was putting out lots of heat and shut down a couple of times. Bought this stand and it has completely dissipated the heat from it.
Rating: 5, Review: The media could not be loaded. Had no issues with this thing. Would only like if it could be slightly bigger. I put my laptop and usb hub on it because both get so hot without it.
Rating: 5, Review: When I was on my laptop for a long time it would heat up so I got this pad. It works well.
Rating: 5, Review: This cooling pad gets the job done as intended. It cools my laptop and is quiet. I also like the pretty blue lights on the fans.
Rating: 5, Review: Laptop was running so hot you couldn't keep it on your lap, with this fan the laptop is not so cool so don't really know it's there. Will be getting another one for my wife's laptop.
Rating: 5, Review: 3 fans provide adequate cooling, my laptop fan almost never turns on. Fairly silent, can still hear the fans but nothing distracting. Just not whisper quiet if that's important to you. simple setup. seems well made so let's see if this one lasts
Rating: 4, Review: My laptop is consistently more loud than the fan cooler, but the fans are nice and push air through. I won't say it demonstrably keeps it cooler, but even 5 degrees is better than what it was at before.
Rating: 1, Review: no lip at the bottom to hold the laptop, instead it came with some cheap stickers. and LED fans are unsightly and unnecessary. no way to turn them off either. fans arent too loud but they do make a high pitch noise.
Rating: 3, Review: My laptop gets hot FAST so I bought this. While the keyboard was still hot. It was cooler than it usually would be.
Rating: 4, Review: Very good product but make sure you estimate the USB cord length correctly to have enough to connect to your computer slots
Rating: 5, Review: This bad boy moves some air…and does it quietly. Heck, the room has to be perfectly quiet to hear it at all. I’m ordering another for my other computer.
Rating: 5, Review: It works perfectly and allows airflow to my laptop.
Rating: 1, Review: It's quiet because it has no power. You can barely feel the breeze is coming off it. For clarification, I don't use my computer to game. I use it for Zoom meetings and non gpu/cpu heavy data analysis/science work.
Rating: 3, Review: Como pueden ver la imagen, la única forma de hacerlo funcionar es con un adaptador de multiples puertos. Intenté con un cable USB a USB-C y no funcionó. También probe con un adaptador de USB a USB-C y tampoco funciono. Hoy día ya los computadores vienen con puertos USB-C y este cooling pad no viene con la configuración de si no quiere o no puede usar el cable USB a USB, que pueda reemplazar únicamente el cable por un USB a USB-C.
Rating: 1, Review: Was doing it's job until one day it stopped working. Customer service ignoring me
Rating: 2, Review: Daughter has one, she swore by it, so I got one as well. Not only does it not cool my laptop, but it never cooled my daughter’s, either. Testing with onboard software (ASUS Armoury Crate) shows absolutely no effect with or without the cooling pad. Air coming out of the pad takes the path of least resistance, and just gets pushed out the sides under the laptop. Any actual air that would be drawn up into it is negligible. I added duct tape to direct the air more towards the center of the pad to help with the outflow under the laptop, but not much improvement. It would be a positive that the pad is very quiet, but that just means the fans are low speed and there’s no option to increase their speed to push more air.  Just a complete waste of money.
Rating: 5, Review: I have a gaming laptop that I use for multiple purposes such as games, business or school. Laptops can heat up very quickly and having a laptop stand with fans inside to keep your laptop cool is very important for longevity of your laptop. Also having a very hot laptop in your lap can be uncomfortable, so this is a fantastic buy.
Rating: 5, Review: Works great and very quiet. I have had this running non stop for 3-4 weeks now and it's still going strong.
Rating: 5, Review: I have an older computer. When I try to play games, the fan sounds like the computer is about to takeoff. The fan was struggling so hard. I even took apart the computer just to make sure that everything inside was working okay. Turns out it’s just old.  So far the fan still does come on on my computer, but it’s not running like it’s about to die. It seems like this helps my old machine run a lot better!
Rating: 4, Review: I bought this for a new gaming computer and to ensure the laptop had a good cooling pad to avoid unnecessary stress on the laptops fans. So far, so good. Seems to keep the gaming laptops fans running at a lower speed and the laptop is kept cool.

It's supposed to be designed for a child, so one would think it would be easy to navigate. It is not. Little to nothing is self explanatory, and I feel like 95% of the screen is trying to get you to buy more and more and more. The battery life also leaves something to be desired. An iPad is definitely more money, but it's also definitely more easy to use. Overall, the case is the best feature, it does keep the device protected.
Rating: 1, Review: The tablet is so slow, and you have to touch it just perfectly to be able to go back or go home. I wish I bought my daughter an iPad instead.
Rating: 1, Review: This is the most non user friebdly tablet I've ever used. Not to mention, the storage is a huge problem. The necessary systems take up most of the storage space so I constantly need to delete apps and clear the cache for my kid to play something else.  Now it just gives us error messages and won't let anything download. I would have been better off getting a regular tablet through another brand.
Rating: 1, Review: Bought the 16GB model. ""The system"" takes up 7.6GB just to run. When I look under storage, it says I am using 9.98GB of 10.88GB. Where's the other 6GBs? No room to install apps. Waste of money.
Rating: 1, Review: Got 2 for my twins birthday and one doesn’t work. Now I won’t have anything for them to open.
Rating: 5, Review: My great granddaughter is 2 she loves it only used for her to do schoolwork
Rating: 1, Review: I tot there would be an app where my kids could watch YouTube kids. But there isn’t. My son won’t even use the tablet and rather have my phone. 🙄
Rating: 5, Review: I like everything I order and my niece love the iTablet
Rating: 3, Review: so my kid went from an Ipad (because the screen is shattered) to this android. definitely mid because it’s android so I already knew it wasn’t the best. Some apps/videos crash. The screen gets frozen sometimes to where I have to restart it. It does the job with Netflix & Disney. Someone said there was kids YouTube, definitely lied. There’s regular YouTube but I was looking more for the kids YT. I say this was worth 30$ for a 2 year old. Don’t feel like returning it so it’s okay.
Rating: 4, Review: Had a hard time at first the sound was terrible. Finally got it figured out. Granddaughter loves it.
Rating: 5, Review: Durable, lasts long, many options. Very enjoyable and entertaining.
Rating: 5, Review: Bought this for my five year old she loves it. My only complaint is I bought a memory card to go with it and it's hard to download more books and games on it. Also it's kind of a pain to control certain shows and games to play... Once you get it all figured out there's lots of educational stuff for it. Kids think they're just playing when it's actually teaching them.
Rating: 3, Review: The media could not be loaded. We got this less than a month ago and the speakers have blown and sounds crackly. We got the tablet for my toddler to watch Netflix. It was working fine but then today the speaker blew and now it sounds horrible. Other than that it is a great basic tablet, like I said we just use it for Netflix.
Rating: 2, Review: The product is durable, other than that it's not really usable for my 4 year old. We continuously get a low memory error despite having over 120gb free. The memory card is formatted as internal storage, nothing from the kids profile will save to it. Items from the adult profiles will, but I bought this specifically for my child.  I've gone through the customer service recommended actions and nothing will fix the problem, but I did find a thread of many other people having the same error.  I was not a fan of the kids+ subscription, I wish there was a way to only download the 5 apps I want my child to use. It's very overwhelming for a child. I had to deactivate it to do this. So now we have the subscription and tablet, but do not use it.  Save yourself the money and get a Samsung tablet with a good case.
Rating: 3, Review: I pretty much like the tablet but we got it for our girl mainly to watch her favorite YouTube Spanish educational videos however we can’t even watch them on the browser so it’s not helping us for what we need just for what the tablet offer! We will return it as soon as we are back from our trip

Rating: 2, Review: DONT BUY THIS : - This tablet was purchased as a gift for my 4 yr old granddaughter.. in October was given at Christmas only used for 5 months by a 4 yr old. ..it now won’t allow for any changes to the storage. So once it’s full it’s full and you can’t delete anything. It won’t let me remove any apps and I’ve tried multiple times, using multiple different tutorials on YouTube to try and remove stuff with no luck. I went on the parents profile even and tried everything I could and it does not let you delete a single thing. So I finally tried to buy a SD card because if I can’t remove anything maybe I can free up space so stuff can at least update. But even after formatting it different 3 times, and trying to “move apps” more times than I can count and NOTHING transfers, I finally googled what the issue might be and I found a forum from someone who got a direct quote from Amazon saying some apps don’t allow to be saved onto an SD card and have to be internally stored. Basically telling me I spent my money on an SD card for nothing. And so now I have this tablet that is completely full, nothing is saving or will move to the SD card and a lot of apps she can’t even use because they need to update and can’t because there’s not enough room to update. and absolutely no where to get help for this. UPDATE 3 hours on with AMAZON CS who by the way knows NOTHING about the difference between a GUARANTEE and an WARRANTY...was a total waste. HORRIBLE CUSTOMER SERVICE 7 time i had to call back. WORTHLESS its unreal that some of the people who work there have NO idea what CS is truly about. Talking over me and cutting me off does not make them right. THEY are issuing a refund WITH a restocking fee for their WORTHLESS produce that has a GUARENTEE of 2 years. BEWARE DONT buy this

Rating: 5, Review: The media could not be loaded. This is my daughter 4th one (not due to the product) and we love it. She likes this tablet better than an iPad 10/10
Rating: 4, Review: Overall this has been a great product for our 2 year old son! He can drop it or throw it and there won't be any damage to the screen. I also love that the case has the fold out handle that can be used for him to grip the device easier or prop it up somewhere. Battery life is also great!  A few things that I wish could be updated: you can't view an app on the device to get a description before downloading - when you click on it, it just immediately downloads. Also there isn't a way that I have been able to find to block certain YouTube channels or videos. Because of this, we download videos or shows we are okay with him watching and then switch the device to airplane mode so that he cannot watch ones that we haven't downloaded.
Rating: 1, Review: Been using this since Christmas, it no longer charges
Rating: 5, Review: Love this! I have two of these for each kid. Its perfect for traveling. Connects well to hotspots and can download shows to watch off line. Most importantly they do not break when tossed by a toddler. It's worth the price. Get it.
Rating: 1, Review: Storing data will become a nightmare with this device. I even bought a 256 GB SD card to help make more space…it has been an utter disaster dealing with this device. I cannot recommend this product in good conscience to ANYONE.

Rating: 1, Review: Bought this tablet with assurance of the 2 year warranty. Kid broke screen and AMAZON refusing to allow me to return it!!!
Rating: 2, Review: The picture is great, the battery life is great. However- trying to connect it to my phone’s Bluetooth as a hotspot takes about twenty minutes of me struggling to remember the appropriate click pathway. I’ve owned it for months now, but we only use it for my daughter on long car rides and plane trips, so maybe I’m just not familiar enough. But it really shouldn’t be this hard.  If I were to suggest some changes- we need a fewer words, cleaner menus, and more consistent touch patterns. Am I supposed to click this? Drag this down? Do I need to hit this circle or this square or this triangle? We need a more intuitive interface. We need a start up with account selection, a menu button, then a clear route to settings. If those exist and I haven’t found them, I’m going to blame the design and not the user- again, it just shouldn’t be this hard.
Rating: 5, Review: This is the 5th kids Fire Tablet I have purchased over several years for my children. They’re easy to use, easy to set parental controls, and have so many great entertainment choices. I do prefer the 10 inch screen size, although we did have the next size down. We had a problem with the power button on our last tablet and customer service was prompt and easy to resolve the issue by replacing. This model with the Disney princesses is so cute, my 4 year old daughter loves it!

Run away from this. A $20 “charger” powerful enough to literally burn your $1k+ Apple laptops. Interesting how I’ve read dozens of reviews reflecting my own experience: worked fine for the first couple months (while a refund is still available), but then starts getting crazy HOT and will stop charging, eventually burning itself and your laptop if you don’t stop using it.

Rating: 1, Review: I purchased this charger in January'24 after checking the details & reviews ( both good and bad ones). However more recent reviews are true. 1. This charger is not reliable aka its not charging the device properly ( it shows charging but my laptop kept shutting down abruptly while working and then on restart it showed 1% battery). I got my battery tested by Apple and there is no problem with it which made me question the charger's performance. 2. The led light on the charger is not stable. Although my laptop is charging , the light is not orange/ at 100% battery its not green sometimes. 3. Overheating issues which is weird . This makes me question this product's build quality. Sadly i cannot return this product and its a part of tech junk for me now as i need to replace with a new charger. Final Result : Buy at your own risk. Not a good purchase and can damage your device potentially due to all the over-heating and incorrect functioning issues.
Rating: 5, Review: Wow I didn’t realize how much I needed this . Recently my Daughter gave me here old 2011 MacBook Air and I changed battery and noticed the charger wire was worn out. So purchased and it charges faster and the magnet is better . 100% Satisfied along with the battery I purchased thru Amazon.
Rating: 1, Review: It worked great for a few months. After a few months it started getting burning hot and going in and out of working. It is now no longer working at all. Before when it was plugged in a light would come on & now there is no light at all. It is no longer charging my Macbook and how I have to order a new charger as I need my Macbook for school. :(
Rating: 5, Review: this is a good product and I would recommend, but it heats up pretty fast so I would take a break in between charges if you are on it a lot then it will over heat
Rating: 5, Review: It's exactly what I wanted and the shipping is super fast!
Rating: 1, Review: The charger manages to charge my laptop, however, whenever I move my laptop slightly while the charger is plugged in it will shutdown my computer. Extremely annoying, my official Apple charger didn't cause this. After the most recent time it happened, the fans have now been running nonstop at an insane speed that I didn't even know was possible, and haven't stopped even after an SMC reset. Not great! Definitely wouldn't recommend this charger!

Rating: 3, Review: Dock works pretty decent but one of the screens will randomly disconnect multiple times an hour then reconnect
Rating: 2, Review: It is essentially just a glorified USB hub with laptop charging. The monitor ports never worked. They would mess up my laptop's native monitor resolution. My laptop has 2880x1800 native resolution, and my extended monitor has 2560x1440 resolution. I also have a third extended display monitor in portrait mode 1080x1920. Unfortunately, I have to plug the 2k monitor directly into the laptop, and use a usb-graphics adaptor for the HD monitor because the Anker dock bugs out.
Rating: 5, Review: Best thing I could have ever invested in, it works great
Rating: 5, Review: This is a fantastic adapter. I have used a competitors adapter for my MacBook pro for years, and have burned through about an adapter a year for some reason or another. I have had this one almost a year now and its going strong, and is loaded with features compared to my old adapters. Sd card slots, both standard and mini, work fantastic and read quickly, HDMI out works on multiple monitor/tv set ups and the charging port seems to charge just as fast as my MacBooks onboard port, despite me having all of the other accessories running. Will be continuing to look at Anker accessories after this one, couldn't be happier with this adapters performance!

Rating: 1, Review: I used it with HP Victus 16 for running 2 external monitors (Full HD and 4k). It was working sort of ok, but would occasionally lose video output which could be fixed by unplugging and re-plugging. Then after about 3 weeks the video image started to be glitchy on both monitors and eventually it was just a mess of digital artifacts. Nothing would fix it.

Rating: 1, Review: I normally like and trust Anker brand, but unfortunately only one HDMI works. Purchased this because it has two HDMI outputs.
Rating: 3, Review: Bought this docking station, one for me and one for my husband as we work from home. Worked until a windows update for me and now will not process HDMI feeds. Works on my husband's laptop still as it hasn't updated. No driver available to update for this device.
Rating: 5, Review: Perfect size; elegantly plug-and-play. This 8-in-1 hub met my exact needs. I was surprised that the item was smaller than my hand so it takes up very little desk space. Windows 11 easily recognized both HDMI monitors immediately, so I am fully functional with two large monitors and my laptop screen - all extended desktop mode. A longer connecting cable would be helpful so I could place the hub behind everything and more out of sight.
Rating: 1, Review: After two years, the Anker 8 in 1's monitor connection began to blink in and out every time I plugged it in. I plugged the HDMI cables into a different dock and it works just fine. Save your money and try something whose plug-in isn't quite so flexy-bendy.

Rating: 1, Review: This product is junk. I order it and look forward to using it as a hub on my desk setup. It only outputs 30hz with the Surface Pro 8, even though the computer is capable of outputting 60hz over USB C. Other docks I have used, do not have this issue. There are no drivers available on Anker's site to download and try to fix this issue. I tried contacting support over chat but it just replied with some AI bot and didn't give me the option to reach a human. I wouldn't recommend this device, sending it back and buying a dock from another company.
Rating: 2, Review: I bought two of these to try to consolidate the cables going to the two laptops I use all day (and that I often need to pack up and take away from my desk). Both of these new hubs had the same problem: They dropped keystrokes as I typed.  Some details:  The keyboard and mouse both come in via the same USB-A plug. The hub they were replacing had only one monitor connection (which is why I was replacing it), but it never dropped keys. I confirmed that both of these new hubs drop keys, even if the keyboard/mouse connection was the _only_ one attached to the hub (no monitors, no USB-C power, etc.). I tried both USB-A ports on the hubs, and the behavior was the same. I went back to the old hub and confirmed that everything works again. I also confirmed that the keyboard and mouse work fine on a different computer. No matter the configuration, if these hubs are in use, keys drop, and if they are not, keys do not drop.  They were dropping probably 10-20% of key presses on average, sometimes with whole words missing. It's infuriating. The mouse looked fine, but maybe the mouse is sending so much data that it's not as obvious. Not sure about that.  I'm giving it two stars because if you just want 2 monitors, a mouse, and USB-C power, it seems to work just fine. (I didn't test the networking or the card readers.) But for me the keyboard is crucial.  In any case, I'm going to have to return these. This is the first Anker product that's ever failed me -- usually I'm happy to pay more for their quality products.
Rating: 1, Review: I don’t write reviews unless it’s really bad. So highly rated but so misleading. I spent extra money getting this here immediately so I could actually work in the morning. I am desperate to switch out an old splitter that went bad after a decade of use. I checked all the specs and everything supposedly matched perfectly with two of my laptops. Neither one works. The directions to make this work? “Avoid dropping.” “Do not disassemble.” “Do not expose to liquids.” “The safest and safest charge, use original or certified cables.” Directions to download any drivers or link the splitter to anything… nope. You’re gonna have to return it. Customer service? DE, ES, FE, IT, PT, RU, JP, KO… I’m not so stupid as to think that English is anywhere near top of the language heap but even anker.com/support automatically changes to a anker.com/download and only gives you a declaration of conformity and the same exact no-help “directions” that are included with the item. There is no actual support for the item. What a complete waste of time.
Rating: 1, Review: Beware, it works alright with MacOS, but it’s only compatible with windows 10 (not 11)
Rating: 2, Review: This hub sucks. The monitors go out all the time. I think the hub ports are faulty. I have to shake the hub to get my monitors back on. I've only had it for a few months. Just shook the hub this morning when my left monitor went out. This time, it's just not coming in again. I'm so annoyed now I'm getting a new one! A different one. NOT this one.
Rating: 5, Review: Had to run my dual 32' monitors directly to laptop as this did not allow perfect video pass-through, but overall it, it's fantastic.
Rating: 3, Review: Even though this lists the M1 Macbook Pro, this adapter will not allow you to create an extended desktop with two displays - it will only mirror them. I wish i could keep it, because otherwise the build quality seems nice.
Rating: 1, Review: My Laptop will not let me go to anything but 1024 x 768. I am running a 1440p monitor but have no option to use it. I connected the laptop to the one monitor using the hub and still nothing, everything on my screen looks way to big to comfortably work on it.  I really hope Anker has a solution as the brand itself is really good and I own tons of their products. I am extremely disappointed with this purchase however.

After receiving (in less than 24 hours), I set it up at home. Visiting family, I simply plugged in and it worked great. Good speed and range throughout for a 3 bedroom home. Two devices connected… (laptop & iPhone).  The initial set up could be confusing if you aren’t tech savvy, but after that it’s a great product at an extremely reasonable price.
Rating: 5, Review: Oh wow. This unit's a gem. It has so many features in a small package. With Wireguard VPN (and OpenVPN) built-in, one can bring in one's own configs or use those of other providers. Excellent gain and transmission on 2.4 and 5GHz. There's an excellent, deep level of granularity and customization available, even though you might not need to use it. It's good to know it's there and works great too.  Use the Luci admin panel for open-source custom router rom, it's easy, and browse the 1000s of apps one can install, including DNSCrypt and DOH and lots of adblocking. It has its own admin interface too. It's almost like also having a Pihole in the same wifi unit. I'm thinking of tying in a whole series of LAN devices into it not just for travel to have uniform adblocking and encryption throughout. Be sure to make backups as you go along, because as with advanced features, it's possible for errors to arise. It can also be a plug in and go box, without getting into all its features.  The tech support is excellent, with help built in to the admin panels, and documentation on the website. Chat and phone is also available.  5 out of 5 stars, all around. Great price too.
Rating: 5, Review: This item allows me to extend a hardline network, but lets me keep all of my devices from being accessed by others on the network to which it is attached. The small size and turnkey startup makes it great for dropping into a environment where I have a single network drop and creating my own local area network that is controlled by me.

Rating: 3, Review: Nice repeater for probably most travel applications. However, Royal Caribbean requires latest IPv6 technology. Should have bought the GL.inet Beryl instead for the cruise.
Rating: 5, Review: Easiest set up. I had the cable which is the yellow cable. I used my cable instead of the one it came with. The one it came with was too short. It took less than 5 mn to set it up. I had to reset my ring camera and that was what took a while but a customer service representative helped me fix the ring issues and I was able to connect it to the internet because of this mini router. Easy to set up and use. Great product. I bought the three year protection plan. I hope it never breaks for the next ten years or longer! Great product! The only downside was I tried connecting with customer service was not possible and I couldn't get into the webpage. It directed me to a page that tried to charge my debit card $50 and another $2 and another $50 but luckily I have protection on my bank account and the bank was able to block and prevent those fraud charges from happening at all.
Rating: 5, Review: I use these for ""location"" streaming. I can go to a venue; plug it a local area network (LAN) connection and have my own private, local, wifi network. Ideal for hotel rooms, conference centers, any where you can get a local LAN connection. And... The speed, signal strength is really good! I regularly can easily cover a 45,000 sq ft Convention Ballroom.
Rating: 1, Review: I have used a lot or routers. This is the worst. Won't tether to Android, and somehow corrupted my phone settings. Nasty piece of garbage
Rating: 5, Review: Versatile- you can use it different ways. Setup is easy through the interface. Has good reception. Small and convenient.
Rating: 5, Review: A great find. Router works perfectly and as advertised. I travel with my furry friend and am always concerned with leaving him in the room by himself when I can’t take him with me to places that do not allow pets. I use the Eufy camera as my eyes, the product does not allow for setup and login to a hotel WiFi. I got this gem and was successfully able to connect and add the Eufy cam without any issues. It is travel size small and lightweight. Does not get warm and is safe to use. Signal annd connectivity is consistent. Have not experienced any sort of disruption during us. Includes all sorts of advance settings for those who is knowledgeable in how to set it up. Easy to use and setup. Extremely happy. Must buy for anyone who travels with pets.
Rating: 5, Review: Used this as a repeater that also connects directly to printers via USB and Ethernet. Setup tool is easy to use. Good quality, ease of use, and good signal strength.
Rating: 5, Review: Did the job
Rating: 1, Review: I bought this specifically for file sharing to home network but out of the box the option to select file sharing as shown on their website isn't there. The websites forum says if you update the firmware it removes that feature but it didn't have the feature before OR after updating the firmware. If they can't offer that feature they shouldn't be selling that feature.
Rating: 1, Review: I needed a Wi-Fi WAN / repeater router, and OpenWRT software looked like it would do what I needed. I looked at compatible hardware for OpenWRT firmware, but instead of reflashing a ""big-name product"", I decided to go with the GL.SFT1200 Opal from GL-iNet since it is designed and shipped with OpenWRT firmware. It was easy to set up and verify functionality, doing what I needed initially. But after an hour or two connected to a strong Wi-Fi AP, the connection would drop and remain down for an hour or more before coming back up. This continued for several cycles until it finally remained disconnected. Seems like the radios in the product are a bit sketchy. I replaced with a Peplink Surf Soho router that supports Wi-Fi WAN out of the box, and it is rock solid with the same location and same AP. Good price point on the GL-SFT1200 if it works for you. Maybe mine just had a QA problem with the radio. But working in a remote location without the ability to power-cycle it when it disconnects, I need something more dependable.
Rating: 1, Review: This product:  1- is a sophisticated SCAM 2- you will be forced to provide your credit card info for converting documents types that has nothing to do with this product. 3- it needs to be plugged in to wall outlet. No USB connection
Rating: 5, Review: If you ever use your phone as a hotspot consider getting this or the other models the company sells. I have noticed that teathering a phone rather that using the hotspot gives way faster speeds in most cases. I have bought a few of the different models and use at least one of them every day for work. It has great built in tools to manage networks or to see what device are connected.
Rating: 5, Review: My apartment is around 500 square feet, I get perfect signal throughout the apartment with almost 15 smart fixtures throughout. My apartment puts a limit on devices connected to their internet and this worked absolutely perfectly so far to circumvent that. I would definitely recommend this for a budget option, and upgrade if you need too.
Rating: 3, Review: Didn't work for us on royal carribean cruise. Possible problem is that device would not allow disabling firewall. Not an expert on networking, but have some experience. Tried cloning Ethernet address. Tried making iPad a DMZ host. Somehow the ships WiFi detected router and automatically broke the connection. If anybody has more experience please comment. Other than that device worked great to extend my home WiFi to weak coverage area.
Rating: 1, Review: I really wish that this had worked, it’s so cool but it wouldn’t connect to the wifi and I had to keep reconnecting it. After I reconnect it, it worked for a tiny bit and then I had to reconnect it again. And it only worked for my phone, I need wifi for a camera that I’m trying to set up and it wouldn’t connect at all.
Rating: 5, Review: This little guys awesome, good range, lots of configurations and options! Specifically got this for a tello drone and it works perfectly out of the box! No regurts!
Rating: 5, Review: I bought this several months ago, and I am just writing this review now after really giving it a test run. It works exactly, if not better, than advertised. I began researching solutions to get around captive WiFis that often prevented me from using several devices, including the Echo Dot. It's made traveling so much easier, and I able to connect everything. After several successful uses at hotels and vacation rentals, I most recently took it to Europe where, again, it worked flawless!y. The best part is that there was no reason to reestablish internet connections on my devices since, no matter where I was, they immediately connected to this router, which they had previously connected to. I made the mistake of printing off the PDF manual; you don't need it. Set up is that simple, and I am no tech expert. Great product, great price, and it makes staying connected with my devices so much easier, no matter where I am. Highly recommended!!
Rating: 3, Review: If you're planning on using this as a wifi extender or bridge, be warned. This thing does NOT play nice with other routers for some reason, constantly dropping connection to all of its devices and often suffering from horrible (<1MB/s) download speeds.
Rating: 4, Review: I use this when traveling. IT's usability is kind of limited by the supplied wifi or internet supplied. It works great on my home network. Only issue I had was with one hotel in particular, the internet would be disabled in the late night early morning hours. But this was the connection from the hotel not the router. Worth the money esp if you buy it on sale like I did.
Rating: 5, Review: This thing is so underpriced. It has great features comparible to higher end routers AND has the ability to use your cellphone as an internet source when internet goes down. It has all the basic features and firewall features anyone would need for a home.
Rating: 5, Review: This worked perfect in hotel and cruise.  Very fast and riable with multiple devices connected.  This worked on cruise where others failed. Highly recommend.  Follow directions on their website to get it to work for cruise!
Rating: 5, Review: For frequent travelers who prioritize online security, the GL.iNet GL-SFT1200 (Opal) is a fantastic companion. This pocket-sized router goes beyond simply boosting hotel Wi-Fi; it offers built-in VPN support, creating a secure and encrypted connection wherever you roam.  Security on the Go:  VPN Powerhouse: The Opal shines with its ability to run a VPN client. This allows you to connect to your preferred VPN service, encrypting your internet traffic and masking your online activity on unsecured hotel Wi-Fi networks. Peace of Mind: Knowing your online activity is encrypted can provide peace of mind when using public Wi-Fi, especially for activities like online banking or checking sensitive emails.  Additional Features:  Compact and Portable: The tiny size makes it easy to pack in your carry-on without weighing you down. Dual-Band Wi-Fi: It offers dual-band Wi-Fi (2.4GHz and 5GHz) for a more stable and reliable connection compared to relying solely on hotel Wi-Fi. Wired Connectivity: A Gigabit Ethernet port allows you to connect the Opal to a wired hotel internet connection for potentially faster and more stable speeds.
Rating: 4, Review: I loved it at first sight. It was easy to set up. I installed the Azire VPN as per their recommendations and instructions. It worked like a charm, but the Wi-Fi signal was and still is slow the maximum I've got when running a speed test is 7 Mbs. The physical network connection gives me a similar bandwidth speed. So far, it is doing the job, but if the speed is improved, it would be a nice little router.
Rating: 4, Review: Setup can take a few tries and it does seem to get warm when running.
Rating: 1, Review: When you put it in repeater mode, you no longer have access to the gui. You have to factory reset it. The factory reset button worked 3 times before never working again. I smashed it and tossed it in the garbage.

As the stand that holds the platform just slams into the base, loud metal cling.

Rating: 5, Review: I absolutely love this, it works really well.
Rating: 2, Review: Might be good for a regular laptop but definitely not a modern gaming laptop, it is quiet but that's because it's super weak. Bought it to play fallout 76 because the game overheats my gaming laptop and it didn't make any difference. Laptop still got super overheated pretty fast, only got to play about 20 minutes of the game before the overheating caused my battery life to be basically nothing

Rating: 1, Review: Nice laptop if you don't need any software ouside of MS Store. I tried to switch off Windows 11 S mode for several hours and constantly got error message: ""Try that again Something happened on our end."" Acer tech support by phone said they couldn't fix that and recommended to call Microsoft. MS support applied remote desktop software, reset the system - nothing changed. I tried some advices online, restored and rebooted system several times - no luck. Tried different MS accounts (old mine and new one) - nothing. Bottom line: returned laptop and bought one with regular Windows (not tried it yet). Gregory

Rating: 3, Review: I bought an Acer Aspire 3 July 6th 2023 and it was doing good then in April the touch pad stopped working. I called Acer support and they said it was no longer under warranty. Even though it has a 1 yr warranty the Acer support said it was out of warranty in March. Therefore I had to pay for another warranty and they didn't even help me. My laptop worked with an external mouse and after they got done with things to try my laptop doesn't even work now.
Rating: 2, Review: Purchased this laptop as it was a pick as the best inexpensive laptops for 2024 on many review websites. I'm actually returning this Acer as it has numerous issues. It's an OK laptop, but note that it ships with Windows-S, (only allowed to install apps from the Microsoft Store) but that is easily upgraded if needed. It also has a very cheap and tinny sounding speaker. But we've noticed that when opening it up, it frequently takes a long time to wake up (sometimes rebooting, no rhyme or reason), it frequently drops internet connection, but today just completely froze up and had to do a hard reset. Not what I expect from a brand new laptop.

Rating: 3, Review: The VPN server is easy to set up. However, it defaults to insecure settings. It defaults to the encryption method ""AES-128-CBC"" instead of the more secure ""AES-256-GCM"". It also enables compression, which OpenVPN has warned can be used to break encryption. For a networking and security company, this is inexcusable.

Rating: 1, Review: After having the router constantly drop the internet, a weeks worth of research resetting and rebooting I belive the issue was the inability of this router to deal with Open VPN. I have returned router for refund
Rating: 4, Review: Overall you didn't need the extra features but it's a shame none the less.  Very good range (generally 2.4) I didn't see an automatic option merging all frequencys which is best for different ranges. The 6hz is great; notably reduces a little ping and has enough range for most houses without having to change to lower hz ranges. It has a very standard priority feature (QoS) where you can select up to 10 devices over other but..... You have to pay for a standard set of QoS). It has a nice little ap, and has the future proof 6hz with 5 and the 2.4. In general I'm very happy with the but but I'd like standard to advanced features in an advanced device. Shame on you guys to-link.... Shame..
Rating: 4, Review: Just replaced Netgear N600 with the TP-Link. Coverage is better but a bit inconsistent so far. The real test will be if we get better TV reception (only had the unit one day so far). Not as easy as claimed to set up; I wish companies would spend the extra needed to pay native speakers and copy writers. After an initial hiccup with tech support (guy gave me the wrong url) he successfully guided me through the process of renaming my home network and changing my password. Will need to use this unit for a while before determining if it was worth the cost of upgrading from the old unit.
Rating: 4, Review: Easy setup
Rating: 4, Review: Great product. The only downside is that most phones, tablets and laptops dont support 6E yet unless your device is brand new (late 2023,2024 models) which just started supporting 6E
Rating: 5, Review: The setup of the router was painless, as well as the WIFI extenders. Refining the signal to ensure I have good coverage all of the bands took more time, and required me to call the support team. The support was very good, he helped me navigate the tool to refine the best signal.  Thank you.

Rating: 5, Review: It works great, I did recently purchase the TP Link extender for upstairs. Combined, they are worth their price.
Rating: 3, Review: This router worked really well for 6 months then started dropping the connection on a daily basis. Great wifi coverage until it wasn't. It took me around an hour to jump through all the hoops just to start a warranty claim on the TPlink website - serial number, picture of the serial number, invoice and now the waiting period for the ""team"" to validate the purchase. We'll see if there is any response. I thought this was the best router brand. Now I know better.
Rating: 1, Review: The product works if you are close to it. but the range is terrible on the 5g band. I finally got sick of it and am just outside the return window. So now I am stuck with a $400+ router that doesn't even cover my house. I am going to have to spend more money running cable and setting up access points.
Rating: 2, Review: When you move a little further away from the device, the signal strength drops significantly.  If the device is with you, the signal is strong. It's funny that even though there are so many antennas, it acts like it has only one antenna.  It has easy installation and application. But losing 3/4 of the signal in the next room is unacceptable.
Rating: 2, Review: This router is OK. It takes some time to connect and drops even though my computer is six feet away. It is not long range and you will need an extender to go outside, even close. Set up was easy. I think I liked our Netgear better. I would not buy again. I would go ahead and spend more money on the Netgear Nighthawk.

It constantly loses connection and has huge issues connecting to hotel WiFi. Even on my WiFi at home it’s terribly slow. I have two different models and both have the same issues.
Rating: 5, Review: Great for its compact size and lots of features. I have some familiarity with networking so extremely easy to setup but I can't imagine it will be hard for a non-technical user. Lots of features packed in such a small form factor. My favorite is the adblocking. Overall very satisfied with my purchase.
Rating: 5, Review: This is an excellent travel router for those who work while traveling or want extra security and convenience while on the go. You can tunnel this to your router back home and keep your ip address. So less entering passwords and more privacy.  There are lots of guides online about how to set it up as an openvpn client or WireGuard client. It comes with an Ethernet cable so you might need to pick up an adapter dongle for extra high speeds
Rating: 2, Review: Work ok for times, mainly usb tethering and as wifi repeater. However, after 2 month of use the repeater function stop working. It is unable to detect any wifi signal (even previously connected wifi) and will automatically switch off.
Rating: 5, Review: Must have for trips. Used it to connect to hotel wifi and it worked great.
Rating: 5, Review: I tested this with tethering my iphone, repeating a wifi signal, and using the WAN port. It works great! I don’t have a USB modem and did not test that. It’s got OpenVPN pre-installed. Easy to setup, start and even download the client file. I believe this uses OpenWRT. Not sure if they use wrt’s gui or their own, but it’s super easy and flexible to setup the router. Far different from the days of DD-Wrt. You do NOT need to be a techie to set this up. Great for an extra level of security when traveling, small to carry and great bang for the buck.
Rating: 3, Review: I want to love this thing but I believe it is really made with the Tech savvy in mind. I've watched several videos and I still cannot get the thing to work any of my hotel rooms if there is no CAT cable. I did get to use it at my last VRBO because they had a router I could plug into and broadcast WiFi. I have another trip coming up where I will attempt connecting again but if it doesn't work this time I will probably give the unit to my kids and let them figure it out because that will confirm this router is only for Tech savvy folks.
Rating: 5, Review: This lil guy does a lot without breaking the bank. Share your phone's hotspot with everyone? Check. Setup a physical switch to active a VPN for all traffic through the router? Check. Tack on third party functionality? Check. Also, it's fast, easy to configure and from a reliable brand. External antennas make for prep darn goods range, too. Plus, it fits in your breast pocket so it's easy to travel with.

Rating: 5, Review: I've been researching an appropriate VPN router for a while, and finally settled on this little beast. It was mainly for travel but to ve very honest it is yet to leave the house.... because it serves as a the main household shield without sacrificing speed and connectivity. It is very easy to setup with excellent support and I have only powered it down once since I got it. Amazing dashboard/ Interface. You can use it as a route, repeater or mobile hotspot. An excellent feature is that it supports wire guard.. and many other features... that are just excellent added features.... The only con is that the there is only one LAN ethernet connection and you can MOST DEF LIVE WITH IT... and yet I still have 17 devices connected to it :)

Rating: 5, Review: I was planning on buying an AXT-1800 model but I saw this one on sale. Very easy to setup and the wifi signals are strong and streaming video is very satisfactory over a 5G wifi on multiple Firestick device. I also have a VPN configured on this device and it just works. Amazing product, I also bought a Cody RV TR3000 and will post a comparison later when I done my testing.
Rating: 1, Review: The access to setup is easy, and straightforward, however when settings are changed, like Wireless name, or password, it takes a very long time to reboot. Changing the Channel Bandwidth makes it to freeze totally, and not able to reboot nor able to see router names. Everything has to be reset to the factory default and start from beginning. Bios was updated, when it connected for the first time, but it didn’t help, even resetting of firmware didn’t help. *One important issue – you can’t change the Wireless name of router in both 5Ghz and 2.4Ghz* One or the other has to be disabled so you could change only one of them. Otherwise, both are reset to the factory default when you'r going to change the other one. Definitely a big glitch.
Rating: 5, Review: I didn't think I would need a travel router until now. I'm a techy person but I figure I would just download a vpn client to my laptop or phone. But lately, a lot of hotels have been strict on how many devices you can connect. This is a great way to bypass that restriction.  This is very easy to setup. Once it boots up, just browse to the ip address to setup password then you can connect the router to an existing wifi, plug in ethernet, tether your phone and/or use a modem.  I put this pocket-size router to the test on my recent trip. 4 devices. My laptop, 2 phones, a chromecast. This pocket router performed really well. It was able to handle streaming to my chromecast and my laptop was able to remote access to my work computer without a hiccup or slow down. I do have vpn configured on this device.  This router has features not found on a lot of consumer-grade router, like failover to another active network or load balancing. I'm really surprised. At the time of writing, this device consumes about 15-watt. The provided ac plug is great but if you have a high-wattage usb c wall charger, that will work as well.  Adguard home is excellent. It was able to block a lot of advertisements.  Overall this is great to travel with. Especially if you have a family of devices that you need to connect and don't want to pay extra to lift the hotel's device restrictions or if you value safe browsing or safeguarding your data.
Rating: 5, Review: Used this device during my recent Holland America Norway cruise and it worked as advertised. Very easy to set up and connection was fast w/o any issues. Highly recommended for cruise and travel router.
Rating: 3, Review: I like the router in general. It sets up so easily. My main issue is that it does not work in repeater-mode with the upgraded internet at Marriott hotels. If you purchase the upgrade or get it with elevate status, you cannot use this router. After Googling, this is a common issue. You have to stay on base, slow internet which defeats the purpose of WiFi 6. I tried cloning the MAC address to no avail. I can’t find a posted solution on Glinet forums. This problem does not surface if hardwired to an Ethernet port, but some of the newer hotels do not offer that. I hope a solution comes up some day because I feel like this was a waste.
Rating: 1, Review: After created password and got into the setup portal, all links display ""page not found"" error.
Rating: 5, Review: I bought this with the intention of setting it up as a router with a VPN connection back to my home network. It was easy to setup. Adding the VPN profile was easy. I tested powering it from a power bank and it worked with no issues. My devices connected to it with no problem. I plan to keep it in my travel bag. It makes connecting all of your internet devices simple. Highly recommended.
Rating: 5, Review: Kids needed a VPN to do school work while we traveled and this was perfect. In the road, the family devices could stay connected to a single wifi access point even as we stayed in many different hotels.
Rating: 3, Review: My husband spends a lot of time traveling for work. We like to game together as he uses his portal and I my ps5. It's very intermittent and doesn't quite boost the signal enough to stream all the time.
Rating: 2, Review: I had high hopes for this device, after watching several videos on the product. Let me start out by saying that I had no trouble configuring the router using videos i found online, and the travel router worked fine in my home.  Unfortunately, when I took it out on the road, I found that public WiFi networks (such as at hotels, in airport lounges, etc.) actively block routers trying to log on to their networks. Presumably this is done for the security of other network users, to help prevent MITM (Man in The Middle) type attacks, where someone spoofs the network with a similar sounding network name, so as to steal other users information. So this isn't a totally bad thing that these public facilities actively block travel routers, or any kind of router.  The result is that there are a diminishing number of places where you can even use a product like this, because hotel chains and other public WiFi providers will block you from logging on with this and similar travel routers.  There are threads on this problem you can find by online searching, and from what I could find, there is no easy solution. Whether or not you will want to lug this thing around in your luggage once you find that you can hardly use it, well that question is likely to answer itself. This may be one of the best products of its kind out there, but if its use is actively blocked, then it won't be of much use to you, nor is mine to me.
Rating: 5, Review: I was skeptical at first but the setup was very easy. I was able to add 5 of my most used VPNs including a VPN connection to my home network. I am able to make a wireless repeater for my Chromecast with Google TV and mobile devices. Since I can VPN to my home, I don't have an issue using region blocked content such as Netflix that requires you to sign into your home network every 30 days. Also while visiting Vegas, they only allowed 2 devices to be connected to my account. Well that wasn't a problem when I used my router as a repeater and able to connect all my devices. I would highly recommend this router for travelers on the move.
Rating: 5, Review: Usarlo como travel router es un fly al catcher: Es facil de configurar y tiene internamente un listado de aplicaciones para aumentar aun mas la versatilidad del aparato, tengo bloqueadores de anuncios y politicas de firewall para cuando lo uso en casa. Si resalto que no es para tener muchos dispositivos (mas de 5) conectados via Wifi, ni que la senal llegue lo bastante lejos, es decir, al otro lado del apartamento de 80 metros cuadrados, pero la velocidad es excepcional, es ligero, compacto y me gusta. Otra cosa que resalto es la funcionalidad como repeater en donde puedes tomar una senal wifi que conozcas y que este aparato la repita ampliando el area de conectividad. La verdad es que esa funcionalidad es bastante lenta , he tenido que esperar casi 10 minutos para lograr la conexion y me desespero y prefiero buscar la forma de conectarlo por cable de red.
Rating: 5, Review: Couldn't be happier with this thing. Provides all the travel isolation from crappy hotel networks that I need.
Rating: 5, Review: I previously had a GL-MT300N and whilst it worked, performance was about 6Mbit/s throughput with VPN enabled. I was reluctant to trial multiple different devices to try to find a faster device, but saw a few mentions of good rates in the reviews for the MT3000 so thought worst case I would return it. Performance is 300MBit/s and I am extremely happy with it. Had no trouble getting both WireGuard and OpenVPN working with my VPN provider and got similar performance with both. I have it set up as wired connection to my router for WAN and then both a wired client and multiple wireless clients tunneling through the VPN. A bit more expensive than what I was hoping but given the cheaper models simply don't have the performance I guess you get what you pay for. Couldn't be happier.
Rating: 2, Review: I really wanted to use this travel router. It was not working properly out of the box, so I returned it. When the slate goes on sale next I will try that next.
Rating: 5, Review: Some old reviews/forum posts talk about this router not truly being supported by OpenWRT. It is! There is full open-source support of the whole thing, and you can run the latest ""vanilla"" openwrt image on it. It all works as far as I can tell.  Running OpenWRT with no hassle is a huge selling point for me. It has a ton of neat features (VPN, for example), it has a nicely-done IPv6 stack, and it allows you to make the router work in very specific ways that many consumer-grade routers don't support. I bought this for the price, and because I needed it to work in a very specific way... and it did exactly that with no fuss.  It's intended to be a travel router, but it's a perfectly good router in a small box, that's all. The antenna are fine for an apartment, and if you're doing most of your connecting over wifi, only 1 LAN port is fine.  The wifi is as fast as my internet service itself (theoretically up to 1G/s) with devices that can handle it.  Bottom line: it's a great travel router, good price, and huge bonus points for using OpenWRT. I'd buy another.

I looked up the issue and its a widly known and reported issue that hasnt been patched. The only work around is to SSH into the device and edit the configuration. This is easy for me as I work with Lunix professionally. I just wonder how many unaware buyers and buring these up in just a few months.
Rating: 1, Review: I suspect this takes 220 or 110 but they don't bother to include an adapter for non-US plugins. Your customer service made me jump through a bunch of hoopss just to tell me that they don't sell one either! Now too much time had passed to order one for our upcoming trip. The VPN seems to work and the device seems to work. It's a little heavy or travel when every ounce counts. It gives you a good screen to enter your room number for hotels etc.
Rating: 3, Review: This did not work out of the box at all. A hot mess. Save yourself some time and immediately update the firmware. That resolved most of the issues. Annoying. Other that that, it has worked great so far.
Rating: 1, Review: Set the router up before going on vacation and it worked great in the hotel. When we got to our 2nd hotel, it was a brick. Cannot connect to it, cannot factory reset, it just sits and blinks. There are instructions to De-brick it but requires a computer, ethernet cable etc. Threw it in the trash...
Rating: 5, Review: Extremely feature reach product. I am very happy with it. Main features I was shopping for were 1. ability to setup VPN on the router and share it for all clients 2. ability to a (hotel or Starbucks) WiFi and use that as gateway for the router's own dhcp clients For both tasks this little box passed with flying colors. The interface could have a bit more intuitive, but I guess you can't have it all. Added benefit was that it uses USB-C as power source. This way your own laptop or a (good) power bank can be the power source. This can be important when there is no outlets available.  Great product. Buy with confidence.
Rating: 5, Review: Bought this before a trip to Taiwan and was the best thing I brought on the trip. Hotel we stayed at had decent free WiFi ~50 Mbps up and down but no wired Ethernet for my laptop. I followed another reviewers recommendation to unplug the TV Ethernet and plug in the travel router to the wall and Wow I got ~500 Mbps up and down. Plus all my devices were already previously paired to the router from the last hotel so it was seamless and automatic. Highly highly recommended if you are a tech guy/gal that uses WiFi a lot when traveling and want the fastest connection possible.
Rating: 4, Review: This tiny router has all the good features can easily connect to my home wifi, my only concern is the privacy/ secuirity of this device , i observed it automatically connect to the device manufacturer locatiion to get device updates and there is no option to disable it
Rating: 5, Review: Used this during recent travel and it was everything it promised to be. It works well as a WiFi repeater / router. The engineers thought through several use cases and incorporated into the interface very intuitively. Good value for the money. The usb c power is perfect for travel too. It supported three devices pretty well.

Rating: 2, Review: This is a solid router -- has worked well distributing hotel wifi to different devices.  The one problem is that I've been completely unable to tether it to my iPhone 12 -- spent several hours reading the docs, resetting the device(s), rebooting, etc -- it just never appears as a possible tethering device.
Rating: 5, Review: Fantastic and super easy to use router. This is a fantastic implementation of DDWrt on good hardware. Very easy to set up and use, the dashboard GUI is intuitive and well laid out. Every package you can imagine is available for install, but this works extremely well out of the box with minimal configuration. I found it extremely easy to drag/drop the Nordlayer openvpn config file directly in the GUI - all devices that connect to the WiFi are default protected. My background is a network engineer so configuration for me is almost cheating.. but most anyone could easily use this device. It's that good.

Rating: 5, Review: Muy bueno.
Rating: 5, Review: excellent router, full of features
Rating: 4, Review: The two features that I would deem important in a travel router is the ability to power it in two scenarios: travel outside of the US & since it has a USB-C port powering from a powerbank type battery. However, this only ships with the US adapter and there doesn't appear to be an EU adapter readily available for it. Also, consider the presence of the USB-C port doesn't mean you will be able to easily power from a powerbank. This thing has a power draw of up to 4amps and I have not been able to find a power bank capable of more than 3amp per output. If you're traveling within the US this router makes sense. Lastly I haven't been able to see the toggle button work whatsoever even though I have everything setup appropriately
Rating: 5, Review: This little wifi router performed flawlessly on our family vacation. I pre-configured it before leaving so it had the same SSID and PW as our home router so we didn't have to reconfigure our cell phones or FireTV stick.

I was in a very old European house with thick solid stone walls and even in that environment I was getting 150-200mbs repeating the fiber router that was one floor above or below through stone.  Lots of options in the menu, great VPN abilities, well worth the price.
Rating: 5, Review: I purchased this router a week before my international trip. The initial setup was straightforward. The router itself is the right size, and WIFI speeds are ultra-fast. I will buy a second unit soon as a gift for my brother.
Rating: 5, Review: This is not only good for traveling, it's also amazing for providing a small local network. We have been using it for over a month now. It's so powerful, and the performance is solid. Overall, we are very happy with device and highly recommend it, especially for those who have a T-Mobile business cell phone plan, which usually offers an extra line for free. Since we have an extra line and extra cell phones, and T-Mobile offers 200GB premium HS data, this little device connects to our existing switch effortlessly. We were worried about the cell phone battery draining, but since we dedicate this cell phone line for our networking, the cell phone connects to this device all the time, so the phone battery has not been an issue at all. We are pleasantly surprised that this device delivers a steady T-Mobile 5G HS speed, and the WiFi signal reaches farther, which is much better than what we have with AT&T fiber internet. So we canceled our AT&T Fiber internet subscription. The only thing is the device is kind of hot while running, but we got this $13 super quiet fan from Amazon https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00G05A2MU?psc=1&ref=ppx_yo2ov_dt_b_product_details, which really cools it down :-)
Rating: 2, Review: The toggle switch is flimsy and while it still switches, suddenly after 3 months stopped actually working to switch settings on and off. There's something inside that must be disconnected, I am not sure. So while it works, I like it, it functions when traveling to login to hotel WiFi and broadcast to all devices, and AdGuard and Wireguard features are awesome, I am bummed the toggle button doesn't work because that was a neat feature.  I did contact customer support. I got basically to strings of emails one from somewhere and another from Hong Kong. They basically said I had to return the device first, then once returned they would then send me a replacement if deemed broken. I noted I was traveling and wanted to copy everything from one device to the other but they wouldn't send me one first. So because of the broken unit, and unwillingness to work with me on a more convenient solution for the fix, I am giving 2 stars.

Maybe internet input LAN is also can be internet input I have no idea I can connect my 2 PC storage wireless now I might not be able to use all of the features because network storage feature is more than enough for me This can connect to 1 wifi This can share 5Ghz and 2.4Ghz, both active at the same time 2 Admin, 2 guest, so 4 wifi output That's nice For future improvement, i think it would be great if this can connect to 2 wifi, built in battery wifi 7, ssd instead of micro sd, bitlocker ssd if possible MX Player Pro is working best with this on android, 4k 60fps is ok but 8k 60fps is no

Rating: 4, Review: I’m going to start off and say that this thing is working great, but I had some trouble starting off.  Out of box, when plugged in, I could connect to it, but I couldn’t get any web interface to load. Trying everything got me nowhere, and I ended up to the point where I just had to do a new firmware flash on it. The firmware recovery flash procedure was pretty easy, but just frustrating that I had to do that on a device that was effectively softbricked out of box. Once flashed, I was good to go. I pulled down a wireguard config from my Unifi Dream Machine at home, dropped it into this little guy, and was quickly browsing and connected through my home network without any trouble.  Even with this experience, I think it’s a great travel router. Just be prepared for some trouble if you aren’t technically inclined.

I do occasionally do I get back into my office when I need to print something, however.  I purchased this because I got tired of having to climb under the desk to plug the laptop back in when I needed it to be there, then climb under the desk to unplug the laptop to take it to my living room and plug it in there. This way, I will be able to keep the cord plugged in in each room and just plug it into the laptop for power in whichever room I am using it.  I tried it out as soon as I received it and it fits perfectly!

Rating: 5, Review: I got this charger for a Lenovo computer I got from a friend for college. It works great, give a quick charge and has a great cord length that is useful in most areas. The only downside to this charger is the plug in block being quite large. Might not be great if you don't have the space for it, but if you do then no worries! Overall great product!

Rating: 5, Review: I bought this cord to replace my old Apple cord that lasted all of a year or two. And to be honest with you, I got tired of replacing my official Apple product so often. So I said to myself, just get something cheap because I plan on getting a new laptop soon. So far, it has endured over a month of use and I haven't had any issues with it. It readily charges my laptop at the same rate as my old official one and it doesnt get overheated and such. Nor has the plug portion become twisted and bulging. As for the price, it can't be beat.

Rating: 5, Review: Easy to use and install. Hightly recomended.
Rating: 3, Review: It losses connection from one or another from to time and needs to be reset a few times to work again. But its not so bad being cheap and all.
Rating: 5, Review: We just moved, and got t-mobile home internet. The internet itself is not the problem, but the best spot for the gateway/modem is as far away as possible from where we put our TV. The connection has been on the fence for the tv, and often buffers, then just disconnects. I had no idea about mesh networks, and after reading about hiw bad extenders can be, decided to try this. Got the 2 pack, and so far, seems to be all we need. I haven't got the tvs set up upstairs yet, but if I have to buy a single Deco to add on I will. We don't do heavy online gaming, but we stream a lot and have a Switch, and so far, this works great for that.
Rating: 2, Review: Continuously drops connections to 2.4Ghz devices such as my home security alarm and is unable to connect to others like my home thermostat! After loosing the connection to my home security system I am unable to reconnect! Will try support! Was unable to get any conclusive support.
Rating: 3, Review: I'm one month away from my 1 year review, figure I would leave it a little earlier since for the past few months I have been having a great deal of issues. The Decos have been loosing connection, I tried restarting them, moving them closer to the main deco, switching them up & I still have these issues. Nothing has changed with my internet, I only use the deco to have the capability to be hardwired in my office upstairs. It started off great but now it's just a okay product that i probably will change out.
Rating: 5, Review: My prior set up, with a TP-Link router and extenders, was never a problem. But we started experiencing connectivity issues. That's when I realized that router was ten years old. Man, time flies.  After adding this system, our speed increased 4x throughout and outside the house. What a difference. At a relatively modest price. We're now getting near the max of what our internet speed is rated, no matter where I connect.  Oh, and yes, the set-up was stupidly easy. Way easier than I experienced in the old days.  Nice to see a brand that has gotten exponentially better over ten years...and happy to give this positive review.
Rating: 5, Review: Best range extender you can use, stable connection.
Rating: 2, Review: The S4 Deco I bought 2 years ago were working great then my neighbor gave me 2 X20 to blend with them and it worked great until a week ago. The main Deco,X20, must have a bug of some type. When I open the Deco app it shows all the Decos offline except for the main one. I open each deco and it shows connected clients from in my house. The system is not doing mesh anymore, the connected items stay where they are and don’t change to another Deco. And some of my neighbors clients are showings on my decos even though they are disconnected according to my app. TP Link so far for a week has been very little help, and now I am told by them the whole support group is on vacation until May 6th and I will have to wait. With my neighbors stuff showing on mine that seems like a security issue and he isn’t happy about that either. Just beware!!! !!
Rating: 2, Review: The network is completely unstable and always goes in and out
Rating: 2, Review: Pretty disappointed with all the 5 star ratings. Started with three units in a single story 2200 sq ft home. Could not get full coverage and deco nodes showed weak to fair signal. Bought another node which made 3 nodes now and one main. Got strong signal to 2 nodes and still just fair in garage. I have a few security cameras on the exterior and I had to place nodes literally within 10 feet of cameras to get them a strong signal. They were lagging bad and now they drop off and have to pair them like every day. I run several iot devices like smart bulbs, plugs, relays etc. have tvs, iOS devices all set up on mesh. Full time job trouble shooting and was expecting this was going to be the solution. It works but pretty crappy and unstable. I’m plugged directly into AT&T router and have a good signal to main Deco. The nodes do not manage mesh devices well. Slow and lagging. Nodes are roughly 20’ apart and still the one in the garage I can only get to fair signal. Buyers remorse. It doesn’t live up to what they advertise.

Rating: 5, Review: Great solution for a consistent bandwidth distribution within the house and areas around it. My issues are gone after using this product.
Rating: 1, Review: Was never able to complete set up, everything about the product came off cheap. The App was not clear and frustratingly difficult, customer support was only available through international calls to China and it didn't even connect, just went in circles through automated recordings. Extremely difficult to set up. Stay away from this brand.
Rating: 5, Review: Esto realmente ha funcionado, no tengo problemas en mi casa desde que compré esto.
Rating: 4, Review: If you have the time and patience to setup and maintain this, go for it. It should be easy, but took 6 hours. Have to reboot the units about every other week because the system keeps going down or devices drop off at random. Having the phone connected consistently is a major hurdle.

Rating: 2, Review: The charger quality was not what I expected, it takes long to charge my laptop
Rating: 5, Review: If you're in need of a dependable replacement charger for your MacBook Air or older MacBook Pro, look no further than this AC 45W Power T-Tip Connector Adapter. I recently purchased this charger for my MacBook Pro 13-inch (2014 model), and I couldn't be more pleased with its performance.  First and foremost, compatibility is key, and this charger is specifically designed for MacBook Air/Pro models from 2012 to 2017. It's reassuring to know that I can trust it to power my laptop without any compatibility issues (We all know how Apple can be).  In terms of functionality, this charger delivers exactly what it promises. The 45W power output ensures a fast and efficient charge, allowing me to quickly replenish my MacBook's battery when needed. The T-Tip connector shape provides a secure and stable connection, minimizing the risk of accidental disconnection. It is the mag-charge so I never fear of ripping my laptop off my desk due to getting tangled up in the charging cable, it pops right off.  One of the standout features of this charger is its durability. The sturdy construction and high-quality materials inspire confidence that it will withstand the rigors of daily use. Plus, the compact design makes it convenient to carry in my bag or keep on my desk without taking up too much space.  Overall, the AC 45W Power T-Tip Connector Adapter is a reliable and affordable solution for anyone in need of a replacement charger for their MacBook Air/Pro. With its compatibility, fast charging capabilities, and durable construction, it's a must-have accessory for any MacBook Air/Pro owner. Highly recommended!

Rating: 4, Review: Bought this charger as a replacement for my original MacBook Air (2017) charger. It works well and does the job. The biggest differences between this one and my original is that it does take a little bit longer to charge my laptop so I usually leave it charging while i'm not using it, and the light that indicates when it is actively charging and when the battery is full is pretty dim and hard to see. Other than that, a generally good replacement for what I need.

Rating: 2, Review: Purchased one of these to test. When it proved to be the fastest USB C charger in the house, I purchased 5 more.  Fast forward six months....they have all failed at the terminal mail port to the device to be charged. All SIX were thrown away.  DO NO PURCHASE, UNLESS YOU ONLY WANT IT TO WORK FOR 30-90 DAYS.  GOOD F-ING LUCK OTHERWISE!

The Apple charger tend to overheat the computer batteries which makes it hard to re-start but those that I just bought, appear to somehow be different. Any which way, it solved a problem for me.

It would be finicky and show charging...then not...then charging..then not...and you'd have to wiggle it. Tonight when I went to pull it out of my laptop it broke and got stuck in my charger port! Doesn't work anymore....so pretty bummed out I bought this and it didn't even last a year! -_-

Rating: 2, Review: Stopped working reliably after 6 months and now barely works. Makes an electrical clicking noise when I charge, which I'd imagine is some sort of fire safety issue.
Rating: 1, Review: The cord does not charge and looks to have been made very cheap. It has been of no use, since it does not charge .

Rating: 5, Review: Great for price it isn’t quite Apple quality but works well
Rating: 3, Review: I lost my charger and needed a replacement. Didn’t want to pay too much for a replacement. The charger works, but it does get hot as you charge. If you’re a perfectionist and want your products to look a certain way then you may not want to get this. When I opened the packaging I noticed that there’s a slight gap near the adapter part and a gap near the type c cord part. I’ve charged it in the current condition and works fine, just don’t put your body parts near the plug since it gets hot.

Rating: 1, Review: How does a charger stop working? This one did after a year. I bought this as a travel charger and use it on the road 2-3 times a month at best. The cable gets no power. Should have stuck with the OEM brand.
Rating: 1, Review: Performance is terrible. Waste of money and probably a scam.
Rating: 1, Review: Bought this 4 months ago because the cable failed on my original, unfortunately not only did the cable start to peel off at the ends within just a couple weeks of use, the USB-C portion fell apart as well making it completely unusable. Disappointed in the quality.
Rating: 5, Review: It works very well.  I wish I had gone to Amazon first. I went to Best Buy, where I bought the computer I need the charger for, and they sold me some Apple charger thing that didn’t work at all but that wasn’t returnable once opened. 😡  Lesson - don’t trust Best Buy.

Rating: 1, Review: Unfortunately this broke within weeks of buying. The wire sheath near the plug immediately began sliding off, and later, the unprotected wires ripped. Low quality overall, cheap feel, terrible durability.
Rating: 1, Review: I bought the charger December 2023. 4 months later, it no longer works. Have to get another charger.
Rating: 1, Review: It was bought for Dell 9510 (XPS15). It failed after 3 months of use (not very extensive). After that I urgently bough truly Dell charger om Amazon, now can only recommend this way. This relatively high wattage chargers seems to be too complicated for after-market manufacturers, though original Dell charger lasted only slightly more than 1 year.

Rating: 1, Review: I had the charger for about a week before I tripped over the cord while it was plugged into my laptop and the USB C connector came unattached from the rest of the charger. I understand there was some human error involved on my part but the whole thing should have unplugged from my computer and should not have broken like this. I am disapointed in the quality.

Rating: 1, Review: Absolute POS. Zero stars. User interface is essentially unusable and the lack of Google Play services compatibility means you can't use many apps you and you child probably enjoy, such as YouTube Kids. Just buy a vanilla android tablet and put it kids mode. DO NOT BUY THIS. I will be returning.
Rating: 5, Review: I bought this for my son . I love Disney it’s the best tablet . it has Disney screen saver on it that you can set on the tablet.
Rating: 5, Review: Great speed, battery life. This is awesome
Rating: 1, Review: Bought this tablet with assurance of the 2 year warranty. Kid broke screen and AMAZON refusing to allow me to return it!!!
Rating: 2, Review: The picture is great, the battery life is great. However- trying to connect it to my phone’s Bluetooth as a hotspot takes about twenty minutes of me struggling to remember the appropriate click pathway. I’ve owned it for months now, but we only use it for my daughter on long car rides and plane trips, so maybe I’m just not familiar enough. But it really shouldn’t be this hard.  If I were to suggest some changes- we need a fewer words, cleaner menus, and more consistent touch patterns. Am I supposed to click this? Drag this down? Do I need to hit this circle or this square or this triangle? We need a more intuitive interface. We need a start up with account selection, a menu button, then a clear route to settings. If those exist and I haven’t found them, I’m going to blame the design and not the user- again, it just shouldn’t be this hard.
Rating: 5, Review: This is the 5th kids Fire Tablet I have purchased over several years for my children. They’re easy to use, easy to set parental controls, and have so many great entertainment choices. I do prefer the 10 inch screen size, although we did have the next size down. We had a problem with the power button on our last tablet and customer service was prompt and easy to resolve the issue by replacing. This model with the Disney princesses is so cute, my 4 year old daughter loves it!

Rating: 5, Review: Vastly superior to apple, durable, user friendly, great cust svce. Great tablet, all my kids have one.
Rating: 1, Review: The tablet worked great for my son with all the different activities on the tablet. I would strongly recommend not buying it for the hard case. I was removing it from the case to clean it, and the tablet cracked across the screen, and I was very gentle with it. hopefully, you can find a different option and save yourself some money and the hassle
Rating: 5, Review: Bought this for my 3 year old. Very easy to use. Battery last a good amount off time too. the screen is very clean and easy too see. This tablet comes with a lot of built in apps and you can change the apps depending on the age of the child.
Rating: 1, Review: I bought this for my toddler. I gave the 1 year amazon kids plus a try and it presents my 3 year old with 9000 options of apps and tons of different categories. This is just obscene. I removed access to 375 apps 1 at a time thinking I was getting to the bottom of the pile and I hadn't even scratched the surface. This is the biggest POS ever. I just want like 5 options THAT I CHOOSE for my kid. This is the worst thing I have ever bought.
Rating: 1, Review: No matter what we do we cannot download YouTube Kids on this tablet. This is a major disappointment because it’s marketed to kids. If you want YouTube Kids don’t buy this product.
Rating: 1, Review: This is supposed to be an easy to operate kids tablet. It is almost non functional for a child due to the constant ad pop ups. Google it, do your research. Get a normal iPad or tablet that is not Amazon.

Rating: 1, Review: the tablet lags, get dirty easily and the touch screen is not sensitive. It is also hard for a child to exit out of an application without the assistance of an adult.
Rating: 1, Review: The operating system is already trying to mess up. It glitches. Apps crash left and right! Can’t exchange it! Truly annoyed and very disappointed! Paid far too much money for this to operate like this in such a short time off after just getting it. Buy something else!

Rating: 2, Review: Have had for less than a month, sometimes it charges. Unable to move the surface as it's charging because of the connection is fickle.
Rating: 3, Review: The charger that was original to my surface pro was able to be inserted with the cord facing the back or the front of the laptop. This charger can only be inserted in one direction. The original charger had a light at the end of it so if it was lit it could be seen from all angles. This charger has a light on the side which makes it difficult to see if it is on unless you turn the laptop and look at it from the side. If you are using your laptop and look down at the charger you can’t see if the light is on or not. It works fine but it has some annoying aspects to it. Definitely not as user friendly as the original.

That is not what I call a free return. I'm thoroughly disgusted.

Rating: 4, Review: Nothing on the item I received identifies this as a Dell power cord and I get an error message when using it with my laptop. It works but you have to learn to overlook the warning every time you reboot. Just wish the seller would be honest about what they're really selling.
Rating: 1, Review: This AC adapter is not worth buying; it's a scam. This item is not from Dell and will cause damage to your laptop. Using it for the past 4 months and has caused my laptop to overheat very quickly. I become aware of a burning smell emanating from the middle of my keyboard just recently, I also experienced poor battery health due to the AC adapter. It will cost me now $160 or more to repair my laptop. Big disappointment.

Rating: 5, Review: My laptop stopped charging and this cord was exactly what I needed. Works great! My laptop hasn't run this fast in months... I wish I realized I earlier that I only needed to swap out the cord!
Rating: 5, Review: Despite all the poor reviews about this not being a Dell product, as advertised, and there being problems with the plug, I decided to order. It was indeed a certified Dell product, and it works perfectly. It’s half the wattage of the one I originally obtained from Dell, but at around 1/6 the price!

Rating: 5, Review: New battery for my lap top required an upgraded power supply. Fits the bill very well.
Rating: 1, Review: This cord is rated for a Dell Inspiron 15 3000. That is exactly the computer model I plugged it into. The computer was shut off, and cooled down. I put the plug into the outlet and within 3 minutes, it was smoking and almost caught the papers on fire that the charger was sitting on. I am sending it back for a full refund, but definitely use caution. I'm not sure if it just didn't mix well with the computer or what, but it wasn't the computer's fault since I was given another charger to try right after this and the final charger was just fine. Works like a charm. It was this charger that caused the issue.
Rating: 5, Review: Works great for my laptop
Rating: 5, Review: After a little more than a month it works as well as the original. Cord lengths similar to original. Much lower price than replacement from Dell. Would buy again if needed.
Rating: 5, Review: It is a real Dell, don’t waste your money buying anything else because it won’t recognize it. If this stops working, I will revise.
Rating: 1, Review: Sent item back for refund because it doesn't fit my Inspiron 17, but received this replacement which was same as original, but doesn't fit. Please refund money.

Rating: 5, Review: This is so easy and simple to adjust to the height you need. 🤗 thank you
Rating: 5, Review: Sturdy. I like my laptop open and at an angle, so this works perfectly. It doesn’t feel cheap or unsteady. I would recommend.
Rating: 5, Review: The media could not be loaded. Amazing!!!!
Rating: 5, Review: Very pleased. It raises my 16 inch laptop screen to eye level yet, remains sturdy enough for me to type on the laptop keyboard if/when necessary. The swivel joints are very stiff, which is necessary to make it sturdy and not wobble. Carefully open it up to the position(s) you want to try so as not to bend or make it cattywampus.
Rating: 3, Review: This stand is sturdy and stabile, so the computer is safe on it. It's a good stand for streaming or ZOOMs but not so good for typing on the keyboard. The holders on either side of the bottom edge that hold the computer in place make typing uncomfortable. It's a good value for the price.
Rating: 5, Review: Very ergonomic. Supports my 14"" MBP and 15"" MBP with no problems. Folds up easily for carrying in my backpack
Rating: 5, Review: I was looking for a laptop stand for the sole purpose of just having my laptop elevated to improve the camera angle for my virtual meetings, so I didn’t want to pay much for one and didn’t expect much out of the product seeing as it was pretty cheap. I am so surprised how sturdy this one is and how great the quality is! I highly recommend.
Rating: 4, Review: Sturdy stand, easy to set up and adjust. This is not designed to be portable, so if you want a stand for on the go, you'd be better off getting a collapsible version. However, for a fixed desk setup this works well and is sturdy. The color finish matches MacBook Pros well.
Rating: 4, Review: I bought this to limit how long I sit when working. It works good for that purpose. I wish it was taller, but because of my height (5’2) it’s almost eye level. If you are taller, maybe look for an alternative. It doesn’t extend up but can either be completely straightened or bent to adjust the height. The ease of bending it was also greatly exaggerated in the reviews. It’s not as hard as people describe. It is stiff, but it takes seconds to bend down for transport, and the material is ideal depending on the weight of your laptop. It also fits in a standard laptop bag.
Rating: 5, Review: I bought one of these to use in my office and like it so much that I bought a second one to use in my home.  I have a 13"" HP Spectre 2-in-1 that I use with an external keyboard and with two external monitors. With this I can perfectly position the HP laptop so that it is at the ideal height between the keyboard and largest monitor.  The hinges on this are nice and tight. This means that your laptop isn't going to move on you. But it also means that you will need two hands to raise and lower it.  It is very sturdy. This adds a little bit of weight, so you aren't going to want to take it in your carry-on when traveling on business trips.
Rating: 5, Review: I bot it as a gift. Received was very happy
Rating: 5, Review: I was a little frustrated at first as it came with no instructions. Yeah it looks simple but I had to refer to the picture online.  Easy to adjust the angle / height that you need.

Rating: 5, Review: Bought this to take to work to lift my laptop. I like that I can use the laptop with it on the stand or my separate keyboard. I can adjust it high enough to be on level with the other screens. It's easy to fold down and put away at the end of the day too.

Rating: 3, Review: Stickers are a good quality and come sealed. Image quality is great on the larger individual character stickers but get a bit grainy with group character images. Alot of stickers are verbiage, aka, phrases and such. Several repeat stickers. Still very much worth the money for bulk variety stickers.

Went through the troubleshooting process to see if that resolved the issue with no dice. I later clicked the link to their main site to try and contact them but received no reply. So now I'm stuck with a steam deck dock that doesn't stay connected to my TV since it's past their 15 day return policy. Would recommend trying other brands or investing a little bit more money on an official Steam Deck Dock.

Rating: 5, Review: Metal frame and quality build. Works perfectly with you Steam Deck charging cord to power it.
Rating: 2, Review: I was visiting the US so I bought a Steam Deck and this Dock but it doesn't work properly. Only the 2 USB ports work; ethernet, HDMI and power don't work and couldn't test them before coming back home, so there goes 30$. Don't care much about the money but I'm disappointed :(
Rating: 3, Review: Tried several chargers to give it the full performance while hooked up to a display and the Ally slowly dies over time.  I'm using a 100 watt charger that's verified to out put 100 watts during testing and still the dock doesn't support more than 25 watts being pushed to it. Leaving to the Ally to slowly drain  Quite annoying when trying to run a display, game, and charge the Ally at the same time. Honestly might just grab the Asus branded 65 watt adapter and use my own stand for the Ally.
Rating: 5, Review: I 100% recommend this or a similar item if you want to game on a flat screen or a bigger screen. The response time is great; there is no lag between my Asus ROG Ally and the TV. The USB ports work great, it can pick up my wireless mouse and keypad from across the room. HDMI port works well and has no lag time either. Overall satisfied. This review is based on gaming with an ASUS ROG ALLY system.
Rating: 1, Review: 1 month in just completely stopped working, checked HDMI checked the deck, it’s a POS
Rating: 5, Review: It's smaller than I thought but doesn't really matter. Materials seem sturdy and all the ports work correctly. The OLED Steam Deck hooked right up and worked immediately. I really like the USB ports because the actual steam deck doesn't have any. So far so good. I'd say the only negative thing about it is that it doesn't come with it's own power supply but for the price it's good.
Rating: 1, Review: Stopped working after just over one month so now I can't return it for a refund. Thanks for wasting my time and money. I'll just use my other Anker docking station that works perfectly.
Rating: 5, Review: Love this stand, I've had it for a few months and it lets me charge my deck out in open while I still feel it is safe and secure. Haven't tried hooking it into a TV for displaying out that way but I am just so happy with it for the price and quality even as a stand!
Rating: 2, Review: Not impressed, unit died after 8 months of very light use. Power supply was always on a UPS. Got the updated unit to see if it lasts longer. While it worked it was a decent dock, expected it to last longer than it did.

Rating: 5, Review: Simple setup, works out of the box with Steam Deck
Rating: 5, Review: Dock works fine No issues
Rating: 4, Review: Works fine for my Rog Ally except when I put a protective case on it. The metal dock cradle has small thin rubber strips in there but I didn't like all that metal pinning in my expensive Rog plastic case. The case I bought does have its own built in stand so it just sits on top of the dock now. I like the compact size of the dock so I can throw in a bag easily.
Rating: 3, Review: This device does the job great and I love how it stands my steam deck. It charges my steam deck as well which is great for playing for extended periods. The set up is pretty compact so it’s not terrible to travel with. The cord to hook up steam deck is a bit janky but does the job.

When I removed my phone and watch from the charger this morning, neither device received any charge. I tried several different traditional methods to get the power supply to function, (plug it into a different electric outlet, different charger cord, etc.), without success. I tried a different power supply with the Belkin charger which performed as expected. I cannot give this power supply any rating above zero stars.

Rating: 3, Review: I'm used to Cricut stickers with no seam and how they can be a little bit of a pain to peel, but these are way worse than that. I've peeled and stuck 6 of these, and 5 of them split into ripped paper on the first try. One of them was almost irredeemable until I finally got a lucky fingernail into the adhesive layer. Also I can tell that several of the stickers use (uncredited) fan art, one was even a Star Wars mashup. Very much feels like a pile of art the seller ripped from a ""Fallout 4"" Google Image search. Also the color and print quality aren't the best. I'm not saying I expected the seller to have checked with Bethesda, but it's clear the seller has no regard for Fallout OR sticker-making, and just wanted to create an ""impulse buy"" item.

Like what??? So I decided to give this much less expensive one a try and it works perfectly! I actually have it plugged into a docking station as I have 2 external monitors (docking station is also USB-C) and I haven’t had any problems. I keep it unplugged when not being used just as a precaution but I have had no issues with it. Wish I had started my shopping here.

Disappointed with the adhesive quality, as the design itself is excellent.

However when I connect a USB device to the docking station such as Logitech wireless mouse/keyboard combo, it work intermittently (at best). I thought it’s a distant or a line of sight. I reduced the distance to less than 6 inches, and a direct line of sight. Neither measure worked. However, if I plug in the USB device directly in the laptop, it works very well at a great distance and without a direct line of sight. My business office uses a Dell docking station (Dell laptop) and doesn’t have the same problem. The other feedback, I wish if the attached USB C cable is 6” longer to give more flexibility. It’s still worth the low cost, it allows me to be a lot more productive.
Rating: 1, Review: I purchased this in order to run to monitors from my one laptop and HDMI output. It doesn't work.
Rating: 4, Review: Works great with my laptop to do everything I need it to.
Rating: 1, Review: The whole reason I bought this was to use dual monitors and the one part of the device that doesn't work is you guessed it, the hdmi ports. I've tried other cords and other laptops and it doesn't work. Unable to contact the seller despite looking all over amazon so I have no choice but to leave a bad review.
Rating: 1, Review: I connected this product to my MacBook Pro and it worked for about 3 minutes and suddenly stopped working. Tried it the next day and it still did not work. I just repackaged it and dumped it in my drawer. I really need a refund or a replacement for this product. How can I contact the product dealers.

Rating: 5, Review: i go this so i can stream games from my chrome book. I was worried it would not work but thankfully it does work i did a test stream after i got it. and did was i needed. but there was a couple this didn't work at first. like when i plugged up i could not get the mouse on the screen. but i did findlay figure it out after looking up videos. but remember this is my first time using anything like this. so anyway i just had to move some screens and in settings and it word. but all in all i'm happy.

Rating: 5, Review: Functions perfectly.
Rating: 3, Review: The docking station worked just as it should when I first received it. Basically plug and play. However, my bluetooth keyboard and mouse that have the receiver plugged into the usb ports are no longer working after the latest Chromebook update. The keyboard and mouse work if I plug the receiver directly into the laptop, so it has to do with the docking station's connection.  I had to reconfigure the screen extension setup after the update, but display mirroring/extension still works. Pretty bummed because having the usb outlets in the docking station was the main reason I purchased.
Rating: 2, Review: Product worked fine for about 3 weeks, then just decided to die. Not exactly what I needed from a docking station I use for work.

Rating: 1, Review: Although described as compatible with Dell laptops, it does not really work with my Dell Latitude 5510. It keeps the laptop going when I have it plugged in, but it does not charge the battery. My system message right off concerned not being able to read the wattage of the charger, and my battery has not gone above 3%. I hope I can return it; it has to keep me going as a plug-in, but I need the portable aspect of my laptop.

Rating: 5, Review: I bought this cord while waiting for mine to be shipped from another state I accidentally forgot mine in. The BIOS notification pops up every time I restart and asks for at least 60W. This cord is 90W but after researching I found that some Dell laptops will never fully charge and charge slowly because Dell wants you to buy the replacement direct from them. I started using the charger Monday morning, kept my laptop plugged in and now Wednesday evening my laptop has about a 40% charge left. It shows that it is charging but it's not charging enough so if you have a Dell, just buy directly from them so you don't experience the painfully slow death of your laptop. I regret buying this cord.

Rating: 5, Review: No problems so far. Great item and now if i have other computers in the future i have tons of choices for a charger. I’d say it’s a great value for money since it has so many ends. Charging works fine.
Rating: 1, Review: MY LAPTOP WAS ORDERED ON JANUARY 30 AND WHEN IT ARRIVED I WAITED UNTIL MY SON-IN-LAW WHO IS A FINANCE EXEC FOR GE IN LOUISVILLE TO BE WITH ME WHEN I LOADED IT AND GOT STARTED BECAUSE THERE WAS ABSOLUTELY NOT 1 DAMN PIECE OF PAPER WITH ANY INSTRUCTIONS ON TO HELP. IT WORKED OK FOR 2 SESSIONS OVER 2 DAYS THEN QUIT. IT WOULD NOT OPEN AND WOULD NOT TAKE A CHARGE. I DO NOT KNOW IF IT IS THE LAPTOP OR THE CHARGER THAT IS BAD. BACK IN THE EARLY 60'S I WAS AN ELECTRONICS TECHNICIAN IN THE UNITED STATES NAVY SUBMARINE SERVICE AND ALWAYS USED PROCESS OF ELIMINATION TO FIND FAULTS. I ORDERED A NEW CHARGER TO VERIFY IF THE OLD CHARGER WAS BAD OR IF IT WAS THE LAPTOP ITSELF. I WANTED A REPLACEMENT CHARGER FOR THE FUNYET BUT THEY SENT ME A UNIVERSAL AND NONE OF THE MALE ADAPTERS FIT SO I AM NOW FACED WITH SENDING IT BACK THANKS TO AMAZON AND NO THANKS TO THE SELLER.

Rating: 1, Review: It was a fast delivery, but no one of 16 tips fit to my laptop. Will have to return
Rating: 2, Review: Having lots of plugs is great but not if the brick doesn’t push enough power. That is the case with this product. It can technically slowly charge my MSI leopard but only if it’s not being used. Using this charger makes gaming impossible, I’ve never had a charger break my game until today. When the PC is using a lot of power they draw from both the batteries and the cable in order to provide enough juice for the CPU and GPU, leading to high preformance, but because this charger provides less than the factory charger the machine gets confused and swaps back and forth between thinking it is charging and not charging, switching preformance modes causes the game to essentially not play. It only switches when the PC is being used for gaming, which is its main purpose so this is totally unusable for me. Even though it adverts for being compatible with my model. It’s only slightly better than not having a cable at all

Rating: 1, Review: This product listed all the laptops it fits, including my brand. It arrived with numerous charger connectors (plug ins?), but NOT one for my brand, which is a very common brand! I was unable to get to the drop off location, which is 2 towns and several miles away before the return deadline. All I wanted was for them to send the right connector.
Rating: 4, Review: The universal A/C adapter comes with a ton of different connectors, which is great. I found the one I needed in the assortment. The only issue I have is that the connectors are so hard to push into the A/C end, that it's annoying. You have to push very hard to get the connected connected to the A/C adapter cable end. Aside from that, I had no issues.
Rating: 2, Review: Didn't have the charging piece we needed.
Rating: 5, Review: Getting the connector on the adapter cord took some strength to get it push on. It powered up my Toshiba laptop so I am very happy. The original Toshiba power cord adapter was recalled by Dynabook (they bought Toshiba Computer). The Toshiba adapter cord is a fire hazard and why it was recalled. The delivery time for a replacement is 3-4 weeks but I had to send them a photo of the adapter with the cord CUT before they would start the process to send a new adapter to me. I needed to work on the computer during that time so I bought this adapter cord to use during that time and when I get the replacement from Dynabook, I will have a spare one. Price was very good and received the next day after ordering.

Rating: 3, Review: Looking at the picture in the description, I thought this would be black letters on a white background. However, once you peel the sticker off the white paper to attach it to the laptop, it's clear with black letters. That means you have black letters on a black laptop making it impossible to read anything. I peeled it off and attached it to white paper so I could read it, but I didn't want to attach it to another label and stick that on my computer, so it's just loose but there when I need to look at it. Not ideal.

Rating: 1, Review: My screen on my laptop has small chips on the edges, but it’s not worth it for me to go through the trouble of shipping it back and then going through all the hassle. I had no time for that. I needed my laptop as soon as possible so I let it slide.
Rating: 1, Review: As a loyal Apple customer, I recently purchased a brand new MacBook with high hopes of a seamless experience. However, my excitement quickly turned to frustration when I encountered significant issues with the Touch ID functionality straight out of the box.  Upon setup, the Touch ID feature was utterly glitchy, refusing to recognize my fingerprint no matter how many times I tried. It was as if the system had a mind of its own, completely ignoring my attempts to register my fingerprint. After struggling for an entire day, I finally managed to get it to work, only to find that it would still intermittently fail to recognize my fingerprint.  What made matters worse was the lack of support from the Apple Store. Despite purchasing the MacBook from an authorized retailer, the Apple Store refused to initiate a return, citing their policy of not accepting returns on Apple products not bought directly from them.  My advice to potential buyers is to avoid the hassle altogether and purchase directly from Apple. While I've always been a fan of their products, this experience left me deeply disappointed. The Touch ID issue, and subsequently having to return the laptop not only disrupted my workflow, but also made me question the quality assurance standards of such a reputable brand. Proceed with caution, and consider buying directly from Apple to avoid similar frustrations.
Rating: 5, Review: I use my laptop for work purposes, connecting to all sorts of external multimedia equipment. I had a MacBook Pro for nearly a decade, and it was more than showing its great age. I knew I needed to upgrade, but I was worried about choosing the Air. I liked the features, I liked the slender form and low weight. I just worried it would not do what I needed it to do.  I needn't have worried. This is better in every sense, and because I'd waited so long to upgrade getting a 2024 MacBook Air easily outclassed my old Pro in every category. I'll for sure never miss my Pro.  It just works.
Rating: 5, Review: The 13.6-inch Liquid Retina display delivers stunning visuals with vibrant colors and sharp details. The M3 chip offers blazing-fast performance, ensuring seamless multitasking and smooth operation. With 8GB of unified memory and 256GB SSD storage, it provides ample space for all your needs. The backlit keyboard and Touch ID add convenience and security, while the 1080p FaceTime HD camera ensures crystal-clear video calls.

Rating: 5, Review: The media could not be loaded. Coming from Windows PC’s this thing eats gaming laptop’s for breakfast…  The MacBook Air doesn’t even have active cooling… Is thinner than my Samsung tablet and gets a steady 60fps in World of Warcraft without sweat and not even heating up… Consumes 15 watts during gameplay plugged in.  Not plugged in and just browsing, word, YouTube consumes about 5% in half a day.  Since I need windows for 2 or 3 things I installed parallels for running windows inside MacOS, and stills runs like Speedy Gonzales ! Battery life tanks from 18 hours to 11 hours running Windows 11 inside MacOS.  Nonetheless this super thin machine is a beast!

My TV continued to have streaming interruptions. Also, the internet would pop off randomly. I sent the product back, and it has been weeks, and I have yet to receive a refund. Don't buy this item if you return it; it may take up to a month to receive your refund—poor customer service.
Rating: 5, Review: This is a great product! You get a great signal for gaming and watching movies online at the same time on multiple devices! Perfect for fiber internet!
Rating: 1, Review: I added these 6+ because customer service told me I would get a boost despite having eero pros on the network. Since then download speeds and upload speeds have been as low as I have ever seen and they show almost full bars on the app. If you have a very large house I don’t recommend. The home I’m in is about 10,000 sqft and I have plenty of EERO’s in the house to get proper coverage. They tell me to reduce the amount of EERO’s have online, but nothing connects if I follow their instructions. I spent hours on the phone and with the EERO’s moving them and reconfiguring. It’s been nothing but a disaster of time and money. If you have a smaller home I would recommend this product. Big house find something more expensive and better than an eero system. I’m very disappointed.

Rating: 5, Review: Pros: Excellent performance Easy to install and manage Controls home automation devices Supports 160MHz channels Cons: Pricey Lacks USB connectivity Some features require a subscription
Rating: 2, Review: What a gigantic waste of time I switched out my existing setup to go with this setup. One thing is is that it's full-time 5g, there's no 2.4, they have a part where you can drop down to 2.4 to connect devices but the problem is it always defaults back up to worked terribly with my with lights and with Alexa 5G and then your devices get confused. Worked terribly with my Wiz smart lights and Alexa. Crappy part is now I have to reconnect my old set up.
Rating: 3, Review: I absolutely hate paywalls! Items are already expensive and now they want you to pay a monthly fee to be able to use parental controls and go more in depth with network data usage. The VPN and Protecting you better from phishing and virus isn't a must have when it comes to networking.  I would have been even more P'd if I paid for the top tier 7 and it had a paywall.  It's my own fault to not doing more research on the app rather basing my decision on the performance reviews.  It has been one of the easiest setup, the range is decent, and so far it's doing what I need it to do.  They put parental control behind the paywall to force you to pay the monthly or yearly fee. Ridiculous, eero brand and other brands need to be avoided if parental control isn't included. I have adult children so I don't have the need for this feature, but come on.  Hardware is, app, and setup are 5 stars.  The paywall for parental control and network data are 1 star and in my opinion very deceptive.

Rating: 1, Review: 5/10/2024 Update I added another extender ($85.00), so I am literally less than 10 feet from the extender (which is less than 15' from the main router) and my download speeds are STILL below 25MBps (on an internet connection that is over 300MBps). GARBAGE. AVOID. My Orbi was an unstable system, but way better than this junk. Unfortunately, I threw away the box and I can't return it.  ORIGINAL This mesh system is supposed to cover 4500 SF??? My house is about 1500 SF, and the coverage is terrible. My desk is in the back bedroom, 22' from one satellite (wood walls, not metal...) and 27' from another and I get 1.85 MBps download! Setting up was very problematic, also. AND, I had to switch all my partner's Alexa devices to MY account (which was also a huge pain in the butt) because they have to be under the same account to work correctly. I replaced an Orbi system because it was so unreliable, not thrilled with EERO 6+ either.
Rating: 1, Review: I typically refrain from giving negative reviews, but purchasing the eero mesh system was the worst decision I've ever made. I've had it for over six months now, and ever since I hooked up this mesh system, I've been having trouble connecting to the internet. Initially, it occurred once or twice a month, but now it's happening every day. I contacted customer support, and after some diagnosis, they advised me to perform a soft reset, which seemed to work for about a month. Upon encountering the issue again, I reached out to customer service once more. They instructed me to conduct a ping test while the network was down to determine if the problem lay with the internet provider. Subsequently, they suggested replacing the Ethernet cable to ascertain if that was the culprit. I used the same Ethernet cable that came with the eero system. In that case, I told them they should provide me with a new cable, but they didn't respond to that.
Rating: 5, Review: Good value
Rating: 5, Review: Increased coverage and strength
Rating: 1, Review: I have a fiber modem and pay for 1 gbps speed. I have 5 of the Eero 6+ mesh routers. When I test the speed coming into the main Eero I get 998 mbps. The max speed I can get these Eeros to output is 300 mbps with the average around 60 mbps and some devices are only pulling 17 mbps and are within 15 feet of the Eero. I restarted them multiple times and even re-setup the network.

Rating: 5, Review: I have been using Eero and many iterations of their products for years. I believe their mesh routers are the best available and the app makes it very easy to keep tabs on your network. I have had very few issues and when they do arise, tech support is always available for a quick solution.
Rating: 4, Review: Work as well as the Orbi system we had previously.
Rating: 5, Review: The eero 6+ was a breeze to set up. I bought the 3 pack. The app was very intuitive and provides all the information you need for a standard setup. If you're a real tech nerd and like to tweek all the parameters you'll need to buy a more expensive mesh system. For the price the eero 6+ can't be beat.
Rating: 3, Review: When it works, it does it good. However, since have installed the mesh, it has frozen (stopped working) as often as Nest Router ever did in its years of operation in the same setup and environment.
Rating: 5, Review: Works great and it solved all the Wi-Fi issues in my home. I'm very pleased
Rating: 5, Review: Like most families we had so many devices attached to our old wi-fi router we always had buffering when streaming. We switched to the eero and upgraded our internet speed and wow what a difference. At any given time we have multiple devices connected to wi-fi and so far no logging and the wi-fi strength covers every inch of our home.
Rating: 1, Review: This item arrived but I didn't open it until our renovations were done and I needed to use it. There are no cords in the packaging and I can tell this item was returned by someone else because there's paint on the side of it. Vital parts are missing and I can never use this but I can't get a refund? Terrible service.
Rating: 5, Review: This is a great product. I connect it to my Xfinity modem and another downstairs to cover the whole house. The signal is great and stable. Each one has a couple of Ethernet connector you can connect to your devices. It is easy to install and setup with the app. This solve the persistent issue we have with other wifi that gave us signal range headache. Highly recommend it.
Rating: 5, Review: I had the Xfinity pods before and they were horrible. Several people recommended these so I purchased especially since we work from home. They were easy to install and coverage has been much better since we installed. They do the job and are not spotty, highly recommend!

Rating: 5, Review: I was leasing a Spectrum Router which lost contact with my smart bulbs every few days. Why? Who knows. I had to pay attention and restart it.  Eero doesn’t make me monitor it. It’s easy to configure and then you can ignore it. This I like.
Rating: 5, Review: So I had the eero 2nd gen and it worked fine but I built a new metal building and extended the driveway, Joshua at Eero customer support was fantastic! I wanted WiFi in my building to which is about 50-60 feet away from my house. Joshua recommended adding a eero 6 to my existing network but after researching prices and the deal Amazon had running bought the eero 6 plus full strength everywhere in my 1,800 sq ft ranch in the new building and out back by the pool and switching systems super easy, had it not been for the updates I would of been done in 15 minutes with everything! What a great upgrade!!!

Rating: 5, Review: Total game changer! Upgraded from a Linksys AC3200 to the Netgear AX 6600 because, I was tired of slow connection speeds and constantly loosing a signal, even after I upgrading from 500 MBPS to 1 GBPS. Holy smokes! I no longer drop from Teams and Google meetings! There is nothing worse than dropping offline while in a client meeting. Buffering and watching the spinny wheel days are over! I wish I had upgraded to this router sooner! Exceptional speed and coverage throughout my 2800 sq ft home. No need for wifi extenders, even in the backyard! Super easy setup, which was my biggest concern, since I had over 20 devices connected to my previous router. Reliability and speed is what I was looking for, and although it's a little pricey, this router efficiently manages numerous devices connected simultaneously without sacrificing speed or stability. Totally worth every penny!

Rating: 1, Review: Requires a smart phone to configure. Could never log into the wifi. Would not take the password on the router. Requiring a smart phone to configure is poor design. I consider this a security issue. I liked netgear up to this point. Will cut over to TP-link or other manufacturers.

Installation of this router was extremely simple! Once installed, I was easily able to attach all my smart devices including TVs, Cell Phones, Cameras and other smart devices. The Admin interface is easy to use and fairly intuitive to anyone who has configured a home router in the past. Measured speeds have been excellent thus far, even with over a dozen simultaneously connected devices, I would highly recommend this router.

Rating: 2, Review: I purchased the unit with high hopes for use in our church but they were dashed after having to place multiple calls to tech support.  I could not get the router to consistently stay active on either the LAN or WiFi. Support (5 techs) had me either reinitialize, reboot, turn off and wait, or my router was under an attack (was in log) and have my iso change my modem address.  Final draw was when it looked like it was working and I tried watching a short Wi-Fi download video it froze up. I have a 1gb download with no one else using it. I switched to my comcast WiFi router and watched the same short WiFi video with no issue.  Pro: 1. signal strength was great 2. I liked the design and it was easy for me to setup Con: 1. Froze up often 2. Tech support was on weak side once the reboot and initialize did not work.
Rating: 5, Review: Overall satisfied with product and I don't normally write reviews, but this product well deserves one. No more drops of buffering from internet service after router was installed. Downloads/uploads are super fast and seamlessly peeformed. A little pricey, but well worth the money. Wish the extra protection service was free for a year then asked for more years protection with the added cost. Just a very nice router. If you enjoy the speed and uninterrupted internet services, then this is your router, hands down.
Rating: 5, Review: This router is a nice improvement over our old router which was just dual band with less range and less connections. We immediately noticed faster speeds and better streaming.
Rating: 4, Review: Just got this router and so far it’s doing great. However, the default password didn’t work until I did a factory reset on it. This leads me to believe someone previously had this router and set their own password before returning it. I’ll keep monitoring for any issues, but wanted to warn everyone.  Other than the router’s password situation, set up was a breeze with the app and router is pulling the same speeds the technician said the modem was receiving on Wednesday.  I’d recommend this router so far; I’ll try to update in a few weeks.

Rating: 2, Review: It’s a very loose fit in my Lenovo Yoga 730. The cord charges it, but you have to be so careful to not bump it or it will fall out of the port. I will most likely return it if I find another replacement.

Rating: 1, Review: have to still use nintendo switch charger bc this pos doesnt work
Rating: 1, Review: STAY AWAY FROM THIS PRODUCT BETTER TO JUST BUY DIRECT FROM A RECOGNIZED BRAND. I bought this product and the sole purpose was so that I could have a power cord to use with my laptop without removing the one that I have in my bag and eventually end up forgetting it at home when I go into the office. I plugged it in and a few minutes after it being plugged in I start smelling this burning odor coming from my laptop. When I looked down and realize that the only place it could be coming from was the power port I pulled it out and smelled it and it fried my port and hence rendered my computer inoperable as it can no longer be charged. I took it into the geek squad and they said that the motherboard need to be replaced and now I have to pay $650 because these guys have a garbage product.
Rating: 1, Review: The charger stopped working after 3 months of regular use... 😅 maybe I got a lemon but still... Not impressed.
Rating: 5, Review: Item works perfectly for my laptop. Secondary benefit as it serves as a super fast charger for my phone. It'll take my phone from under 10% to fully charged in just over an hour.
Rating: 5, Review: This is the 2nd one I’ve bought since my wife kept borrowing mine for her Mac Book Pro. Works great and a lot cheaper then buying a first party Mac or Lenovo charger.  Also in regards to the reviews that say it is too “rigid”: Cords break when you bend them at 90 degrees where they connect to your laptop. It’s been that way forever…this cord is no different. The quality is the same as the first party one
Rating: 1, Review: Charges fine when it worked, but even with regular and reasonable usage, the connection got flimsy quickly and eventually broke. It's cheap ... but it's cheap.
Rating: 1, Review: DO NOT BUY FROM THIS SELLER. Seller sells defective cords. They seem fine at first but quit after a few weeks. Seller refuses to communicate to refund or replace.
Rating: 5, Review: I just hope it last longer than my last one.
Rating: 1, Review: Similar to other reviews, I just went to use it and the end came off. I'm delicate with my chargers but this slid right out of the casing like it was barely hanging on from the start. I've had this since late November and enjoyed how much longer this was than the original I received but now it's just a waste of money.

Rating: 1, Review: The media could not be loaded. Very low quality charger. Survived only for six months. The cable broke and no more working. The cable was too rigid.
Rating: 5, Review: If I could give this 10 stars I would because my granddaughter lost the cord to charge it so I looked it up on Amazon in a whim and found one that was exactly what I needed and it works fine and she's got her Lenovo laptop back, so thank you Amazon for having this on your site
Rating: 5, Review: So far so good on this charging unit I bought as a replacement for my Lenevo X1 ThinkPad Gen 7. Literally broke it and Prime shipping had a new charger delivered to my door the next day day. I do like that it has a charging light, doesn't seem to get hot, and it fast charged my laptop in no time. $50 cheaper than ordering from Lenevo so I am curious about it's durability, will update if I have any problems. Fits in the usb-c port snuggly and the cord length is fine.

Rating: 5, Review: This was replacing the original Lenovo extra travel power cord I bought for my laptop at time of purchase. The original was much smaller and more travel friendly, but obviously not as sturdy, since it broke. Really, just quit working a few weeks ago. This one is a bit heavier and bigger, but clearly will last longer.

Rating: 5, Review: This may be the third or fourth power supply I've run through for the Surface Pro 6. They seem to fail at the low voltage plug. The led can be lit but not passing power, which you learn when the battery goes flat. There's a fix involving taking it apart and re-soldering but it's never worked for me. Ordered this one before 2:00 pm yesterday, delivered before 2:00 pm today -- gotta love it.
Rating: 5, Review: Works perfectly with my surface pro.
Rating: 5, Review: I got this because my original surface charger broke, so far it's been great although I feel like it takes a little longer to fully charge my laptop than the original but that's not a big issue. This is much better than having to pay $70 dollars for the actual windows brand charger.

Rating: 5, Review: Great laptop. Super Fast. Long lived battery. Very thin. Very light. Exquisite display. Typically easy to use Mac OS. Just about Everything works as it should. Great quality. Exquisite engineering.  Most profound recommendation  Negatives: USB-C ports too close together. If use an adapter, ports are too close for most adapters to use two simultaneously. Downloading huge files causes cache to get clogged. Cleaning cache is time consuming. Expensive.
Rating: 1, Review: They are just so “look at me I’m a Mac user”. Then they breakdown, or Apple do a software update that makes them useless, or the charger breaks, then the cost of repair at an Apple shop is so high it’s not worth repairing. Advice to anyone out there don’t fall into the Apple Trap. The phones are even worse. Hands up who has had to buy numerous I phone charging cables. It’s a perpetuating rip-off, we all know it, but we are all suckers.

There are only about 6 that I personally like enough to put on my water bottle. I'm sure my kids will love all the dog stickers....there are a lot of corgis.  Haven't used them yet so I can't speak to their staying power, but they are quite flimsy, so I'm not expecting them to be as durable as my souvenir stickers that are $5 a piece from the national parks.

Rating: 5, Review: This was a birthday gift for my friend and she loved it, the mug has a nice design and the cream colour is really lovely!
Rating: 4, Review: I really like this cup, but it could be better. 1st it's not water proof unless you buy the little accessory. That's the only way. 2nd it keeps ice for 2 to 3 days depending on how much you put in it. The last thing I have to say is water, because that's all I put in mine, does not stay cold without ice. I find myself buying ice just for my cup. Even if I just put water, no ice and sit in the refrigerator, the water will still not be as cold as I think it should be. Leaving it on the night stand over night with no ice, the water will be room temp.
Rating: 4, Review: Love everything except this leaks water the second it’s not perfectly level. Quickly. Everywhere.
Rating: 1, Review: Can’t believe I paid all this money and there was no straw in the cup. Is this even a real Stanley? This was my kids teacher appreciation gift and now I can’t even gift it. Ugh!
Rating: 3, Review: We pickup my granddaughter at school and have to wait in the pickup line about an hour or more. I always bring her a snack and a drink. I bought this thinking the drink would stay cold and the ice wouldn’t melt. All of the ice melted in an hours time. (We live in Florida) I wanted to test this out to see if I wanted to buy additional ones. I was disappointed.
Rating: 1, Review: Anteriormente compré el producto y me gustó por eso lo volví a pedir para un regalo y cuando recibí purés estaba roto 🤯 ya no puedo confiar y piden que les envíe el artículo roto para reembolsarme cuando debería tirarlo a la basura o lo piensan reparar y venderlo.
Rating: 5, Review: Exactly what you want. Brand name and came a day early. Only downside is it doesn't come in the box. But it is market price and still showed up in brand new condition.
Rating: 3, Review: Si ya saben que se filtra el agua deberían de vender desde el inicio los accesorios que uno luego encuentran , con unos empaques para evitar la filtración la cual es demasiada . Después que me llegó me decepcione y obvio salí a comprar los empaques adicionales, es muy pesado y para tomar sin popote (pitillo ) si o si te toca con la mano izq para que la ventana del agua quede hacia tu cara.
Rating: 3, Review: Cuando abrimos la caja, llegó con un defecto de golpe cerca de la base. No es un producto económico por lo que debe ser mejor protegido para que el cliente al recibirlo no tenga estos inconvenientes
Rating: 1, Review: Once the cup arrived, I gave it a hand wash in the sink before using it. I put only plain filtered water inside. I went to give it a second hand wash before using again and found it had rusted in a few spots along the rim (see photos). I bought the 30 oz size in cream color. I’ve had the cup less than a month.
Rating: 5, Review: Came super quick and is perfect!
Rating: 5, Review: My first cup came damaged and dented on one side. But they had a new one on the way within an hour and I just received it. Cup is beautiful in person. I got the green 40oz. Shipping was fast.

Rating: 1, Review: Bought this Stanley because of all the hype that’s been going on about them. Not happy with the cup. It doesn’t hold ice very long at all compared to my yeti cup! Not worth the money. Wouldn’t buy again.
Rating: 1, Review: I tried posting a a first review but it was rejected. I really do think I wasn’t sent the authentic brand. This cup doesn’t hold ice for hours like my other Stanley cups. & the leakage is far beyond my other Stanley’s as well. Something to consider may happen when buying on line. I was sadly disappointed cause I really wanted this color- the blush pink really is pretty though.

They brought mates to come. After a few days, there aren't many ants around the area. This product seems working great to stop the ants coming to the house.
Rating: 5, Review: This product helped me solve my annual spring infestation of tiny black ants. It worked right away and ants were all gone in a day or two. The only problem was it was a little challenging to open by twisting it as directed. Easily solved by anipping it with scissors. It’s been a couple of weeks and the ants haven’t returned.
Rating: 5, Review: This stuff worked like a near miracle for us. We have had days on end of rain and the ants began coming into the kitchen about 2 weeks ago. First one. Then four to six. Then over twenty crawling over our window sill and in the sink. I prefer to use ""all natural"" items but nothing we tried was working. Vinegar was the only thing that slowed them down for a couple of days then they returned in twice the numbers. I researched a lot of products and brands before choosing this one and I have no regrets. It makes a small footprint in our home and it's administered in such a way that our cats can't get into it. After reading the reviews, I decided to use scissors to cut the tab off rather than try to twist it off. We set one trap on the window sill near where we saw the ants and one other trap on the countertop near the window. We put the traps out on Monday evening and by Tuesday evening not an ant was to be seen. We are going to leave the traps out for the 3 months they are supposed to last but will move them to less conspicuous places in the kitchen. We are very pleased with the fast response from these traps and will purchase them again if needed.
Rating: 5, Review: This product comes in a convenient and easy-to-use design, making it ideal for both indoor and outdoor use. The liquid bait effectively lures ants to their demise, swiftly eliminating entire colonies. What sets this ant killer apart is its fast-acting formula, which starts to work within hours, providing quick relief from ant infestations. Plus, its durable construction ensures long-lasting effectiveness, offering peace of mind for homeowners. Say goodbye to ant troubles with TERRO T300B Liquid Ant Killer – it’s a must-have for anyone dealing with these unwelcome guests.
Rating: 5, Review: The short video attached to this product is right on point with the facts based on my experience using this product. Ants are gone and as if they never existed. I do plan on purchasing more to place around entire house.
Rating: 5, Review: Used it to get rid of ants in my motorhome. Awesome product, well worth the money.
Rating: 1, Review: I purchased this in January and have had it out ever since lol, ants are still here. I’m down to the last two packs ants seem to love this stuff
Rating: 4, Review: Works really well. All the ants got stuck inside. Only downside is that the liquid leaks out so don’t put near anything that can touch it
Rating: 5, Review: Best traps I’ve used.
Rating: 4, Review: The product worked great. In about 2 days I saw a large reduction in the population of ants inside my house. After that I no longer see them walking around.  The only complaint is the twist top breaks apart unevenly and is difficult to open, which leads to some spillage of the contents.

Rating: 5, Review: I’ve had a lot of sports bottles over the years. This one is awesome. Easy to hold, keeps things cold, doesn’t leak and it is easy to drink a lot of water at once. Most important, it is easy to keep clean. I also like the quirky colors. It is a big plus that I can carry it with one finger using the hook. The 24 oz size fits in my Toyota cup holder. Definitely worth the expense.
Rating: 5, Review: I love it..
Rating: 1, Review: Worked great for about a month and now the straw constantly falls out. The manufacturer warranty is a joke - offered to replace my lid but there is ONE color to choose from (hot pink/green). They tell you to keep checking back every few weeks for new colors. Really???

Rating: 2, Review: Is that you can’t put hot liquid like coffee in it, which of course, was the reason I bought it.
Rating: 5, Review: If you’re not on the Owala train yet, you’re late - but there’s still more seats. This is the end all - be all to water bottles. Quality is so good, especially with the boot accessory. The all black is cool. Compared to all my water bottles this is the best one. I wouldn’t use this for anything else than water though. No paint peeling. Never any condensation. Keeps water ice cold. 5/5
Rating: 3, Review: I was excited to get my NEW water bottle only to find water in it. I do not want something someone else has been drinking out of.
Rating: 5, Review: It's not only cute, but the free sip style is so easy to drink from. It also keeps my water ice cold for at least a day! The only thing I'd change is to have a handle that is separate from the thing that prevents you from pushing the button to open it.
Rating: 5, Review: I have 2 sizes of this bottle, and both have been wonderful. They truly are leak proof.
Rating: 5, Review: We decided to have these bottles fedexed into the Netherlands. Amazing bottles. The kids and my wife use it on a daily basis.

Rating: 1, Review: RS2 Review here. Bought this for my high school student for school. After 2 months, she noticed the bottom of her backpack damp. A few days later it was worse. I email the company and they felt it was the gasket. Fixed the gasket per their instructions. It still leaked. Customer service offered a 13 dollar voucher for something else. I paid 26 for the bottle. This company is not one I will do business with again. They can keep their 13 dollar voucher. I recommend going elsewhere for a water bottle.

Rating: 5, Review: got a white one myself two-ish years ago. only dented a bit when it fell out of my backpack's side pocket and popped open (totally an issue with my backpack, not related to the bottle at all) and i loved it so much for myself that i got one for my dad for his birthday in 2023. it's been over a year now and it's still going strong! color hasn't faded, his hasn't dented at all, and his water stays cool all day long, even when he forgets it in his warm truck for hours. - black (his) tends to get clearly dirty on the outside area pretty quickly - white (mine) is always pretty gross by the straw. i try to clean it quite often, but due to the way it's constructed, it's not very possible to do so easily.
Rating: 1, Review: Exactly 1 month after purchase the clasp broke! I guess it’s just my luck!
Rating: 1, Review: After only a few months, the plastic where the straw goes into the cap cracked. Then my child dropped it and the top broke off. Useless now. I have other water bottles that have lasted years. This one made it less than 1 year. I really like the design, but wish it held up better.
Rating: 5, Review: I originally bought this water bottle to bring with me on my trip to Disney World to help me stay hydrated and it was amazing!! It held the perfect amount of water and the water stayed cool all day. I love that the water bottle has a handle, which made it easy to carry around the parks, and a straw, which made it easier to drink the water while carrying other necessities. I would recommend for everyone to order this water bottle!!
Rating: 3, Review: This is not the first Owala I have purchased. I also bought one from another seller and it works perfectly. My daughter stole it so I bought another one for myself. I had to return this one three times and I am still not satisfied with how the clipping mechanism works. It is very difficult to close. I am not sure if it is something specific about this color or this lot of water bottles but it looks like I might be sending back my third one. I’m
Rating: 2, Review: I ordered “dreamy field” and the color looked pink. It is most definitely not pink but white. Not even a little pink. Very disappointed in the color. It’s a great bottle though. Love the straw. I would recommend but maybe buy in person so you can see the actual color cause the pictures aren’t accurate.
Rating: 5, Review: Love this bottle! You definitely get your monies worth, it’s great quality and cute color schemes to choose from!
Rating: 5, Review: The newest water bottle….i find myself drinking more water with this bottle. I had went romances stores unable to find one, found one on Amazon and had it the same day!
Rating: 4, Review: I got the boneyard color way because I thought it was off white but it’s actually a super light blue. Almost hard to tell but in certain lighting you will realize it’s not white, it’s blue. The water bottle itself is great, and I’ll definitely keep it. But I wish there were better photos of the boneyard color
Rating: 5, Review: The large size is perfect for exercise class and it’s spill proof!

Rating: 5, Review: I’ve ordered these sheets a few times. Love them.
Rating: 5, Review: I got the Navy Blue color. Absolutely love the color. The material is a bit rough but after a few washes it starts getting softer. If you will be washing them often I recommend using a bit of vinegar when washing them, so it can preserve the color a bit and not fade them. For the price it is a good buy. I will most likely buy more.
Rating: 3, Review: Pros: The sheets are soft and the color was accurate in the pictures.  Cons: These sheets trap heat. I wake up sweating every morning. They also run slightly big, so fitted sheet doesn’t stay on the bed.  Wouldn’t purchase again, but I guess they could be worse.
Rating: 2, Review: They collect dirt very easily, and get stained omg so fast! Maybe it’s just bc they’re black and I’ve always had red and white sheets but I’m not to sure I like them. They’re not super comfy either
Rating: 1, Review: Color was different, it was ugly muddy and muted I wouldn’t have bought it save your money.

We attempted to reach out multiple times to get it replaced with the “lifetime warranty”.  I received an email that we would be getting a new one. The item never arrived. I have tried reaching out again with no response.  I don’t buy the “lifetime warranty” and 2 products breaking so quickly isn’t worth it to me.

I truly love them, but the color of this one just seems off. It’s olive green but doesn’t match the olive green duvet I have from be same brand. It’s off just enough to drive me insane. Has like a yellow cast
Rating: 5, Review: Absolutely LOVE!! Makes my hair sooo soft!!
Rating: 1, Review: The price is cheap, and so is the product. In the photo I added, you can see a tear in the seam. This pillow stayed intact for two nights, that’s it. And the second pillow case that came with this one has strings coming off the seam and looks ready to tear too, and I haven’t used that one yet. I stored it away because I only have one pillow.  I know it’s a cheap price, but I recommend just saving your money and buying better quality pillow cases. This was just a waste of money, and I should have known better.
Rating: 5, Review: Good looking , fits well and very comfortable.
Rating: 1, Review: They would not stay on the pillow..I like the ones with the zipper...thanks
Rating: 5, Review: Feels so good on one's skin and doesn't mess your hair up.
Rating: 2, Review: the closure end of pillowcase was sewn incorrectly. Fabric flap was sewn back ward. If pillow case was inside out then the flap closure would work properly.

Rating: 5, Review: My head keeps falling off but it is nice and smooth and easy to clean.
Rating: 1, Review: They're polyester..sweaty and unpleasant. Guess it's my mistake but if you're a warm sleeper don't get them. I got so sweaty my hair Frizzell and I woke up a mess. No thanks. Happy the price was right..who wants these?
Rating: 2, Review: I have sensory issues and this pillowcase was a nightmare. I got it for my hair thinking it would help my curls. I tried my hardest to sleep with it but the ""silk"" just wasn't soft and it had horrible friction noises (those with sensory problems will understand). If you don't have these I'm sure the pillowcase is awesome!
Rating: 5, Review: I bought these pillowcases three years ago and I’m still loving them! I tried and failed so many other options on Amazon, so if you’re on the hunt look no further. These are superior and have held up so well over the years! I always wash inside out on cold and hang to air dry.
Rating: 1, Review: Polyester! Why would you sleep on that nightly? It’s terrible for you just google it! Returned
Rating: 4, Review: Female with medium length hair. I style at night and have bed head in the morning. The pillow case isn’t a cure all, but it lessens the bed head effect.

Rating: 1, Review: They arrived misshapen and stayed that way, no matter what I tried to make them square. Do not buy
Rating: 1, Review: These are very misleading. After ""fluffing"" for over 15 minutes, they are still so soft and flimsy that an 18x18 pillow looks like a flat tire. Do not buy if you want a nice looking pillow!

Rating: 5, Review: I love my trek mugs! I use them daily, only downside is the color slightly fades over time but still in love and will continue to buy more!
Rating: 5, Review: Love love love my cup 💗 . Keeps my water cold all day and over night. It has kept ice for 3 days straight. I was really rough on the first one, dropped several times on the gym floor and our tile floors at home with no spills, which left dents at the bottom, doesn't stop the functionality but it bothered me, lol!!!!! My go to!!!
Rating: 2, Review: I was told this was a good brand but the ice doesn’t last. I loved the look of it but I’m sad because I already threw the box away so I can’t return it or I would. I’ve never written a review before but for the money I was expecting it to be a better product.
Rating: 5, Review: i love this thing. i purchased a cheaper one from amazon prior that lasted a year until the handle broke. this one was a little more expensive, but a lot more modern looking vs the more stanley look. i love the color & ease of use. it's very durable & great to carry around everywhere. i love how it fits in the car holders & keeps my hydrated throughout the day!
Rating: 5, Review: I love that the lid screws on, the straw doesn't fall out and it fits perfectly in my cup holder. It also holds ice for a really long time.
Rating: 5, Review: Perfect for on-the-go and I prefer this one over my Brumate Era. I feel like this one is lighter and the handle is more comfortable than the Brumate. I believe this came with 2 straws and it is leakproof, as long as you don't have the straw in.
Rating: 5, Review: I love this cup and have used it since I purchased, keeps my water super cold and doesn’t leak. Came with two straws, wish it came with a straw cleaner but that’s okay. Perfect either way.
Rating: 4, Review: The media could not be loaded. I bought this color as it is one of my favorites. It does have a very tiny leak when the straw is not in but leaks when it is in unfortunately. It has the thick walls which helps keep my water at a perfect temp. Looks pretty and very durable! The lid allows you to place the straw in 4 different spots, so great for a lefty or a righty.. Works great for a remote worker like myself, so the leaking doesn't bother me.
Rating: 5, Review: I bought the pink one and it is so bright! I freaking love it lol it's sturdy, and easy to clean! The straw has a good seal on it, it hasn't leaked on me at all lol I will definitely be gifting these to some friends 😄
Rating: 5, Review: These tumblers are amazing! They leak way less than a Stanley and half the price. I own quite a few of these and a few Stanleys and I highly recommend this tumbler over a Stanley hands down
Rating: 5, Review: I’m just going to start off by saying that Stanley’s are so overrated. I truly don’t get the hype and what makes them so much better than any other brand like Simple Modern. This has become my new favorite everyday essential and the color is exactly as pictured and I’m obsessed. I actually really love the fact that the top can be switched into 4 different directions and it stays sealed right. I have a couple different products from this brand and this one has been by far my favorite. If you’re thinking about it just buy it! ⭐️10/10⭐️
Rating: 5, Review: I carry this bottle with me everywhere. Getting compliments all the time. Way more stylish than a Stanley. And the ice stays frozen for 12+ hours!
Rating: 1, Review: Got it in today and I don’t like it… for one it’s not even a simple modern tumbler regardless it came in the simple modern box. It also didn’t come with a straw…it came dented on the bottom. Plus when you are trying to drink anything out of it, it doesn’t really let you get any drink it’s like it picks up every ounce of ice and just blocks your straw from getting anything and when you are done it’s like it releases everything. I know that doesn’t make sense but it’s the best way I can describe it…
Rating: 4, Review: I love Simple modern tumblers they are stylish and they do exactly what they say this sleek leopard pattern print is very nice I like the design it came with two straws the con to this at I filled tumbler with ice and cold refrigerated water now it did get super cold it stayed that way but only for a few hours I say about 5 hours it said it was supposed to be cold for 24 but the ice was completely melted and the water wasn't that much cool I have four simple modern 40 oz tumblers they usually have cold water or drink for almost 22 hours I also have the 24 oz that stayed colder longer overall its a nice tumbler very cute but i wish the performance was better
Rating: 5, Review: I am so happy I chose this over Stanley. Doesn't leak, keeps drink cold forever and color is perfect. Lid is easy to get on and off. Highly recommend.
Rating: 5, Review: I bought this cup going back and forth after looking at the prices of the Stanley’s and the brumates! There are so many cups out there. But this one is perfects durable, holds so much! My favorite cup!
Rating: 3, Review: Very cute design! Can’t wait to use it! Little disappointed that it came with some imperfections (see pics). The SM box was open like it had been taken out at some point before.
Rating: 4, Review: I purchased the 40 oz. Has enough room for a full bottle of water plus ice. I like that it a little slimmer than other brands. Gave 4 stars only because the site reads dishwasher safe, yet the instructions included state ""HANDWASH""
Rating: 5, Review: I love this mug. I’ve had it for almost a year and a half now. It still keeps my water perfectly cold the entire day. I work from home, so the size is perfect because I don’t have to stand up constantly to refill it throughout the day and I can focus more on my job. With just one more refill I get 80oz of water a day, which is plenty for me. It’s a very aesthetically pleasing cup, but it’s also durable. I’ve had no issues with the seal, lid or performance and it’s been over a year. I actually got another one for my husband at the beginning of this year because he continued to grab mine every time he could.
Rating: 5, Review: Me gustó!
Rating: 4, Review: Super cute cup. Keeps my drink cold all day into the next. My only complaint is it isn't leak proof. I do really love the lid, how you are able to lock it in place wherever is nice.
Rating: 5, Review: Love my new cup so much!

Rating: 1, Review: A mi no me funcionó la verdad que llevo más de una semana y nada 🤷‍♀️ yo abro la casa para cocinar para que no se quede el olor y claro me entran moscas lo compré para poder eliminarlas y nada ellas entran y vuelan cerca de esa cosa pero nada para mi que piensan que las luces de una discoteca la verdad porque para ellas es una fiesta literal que se ríen en mi cara
Rating: 1, Review: Doesnt affect flies at all. See the picture with the fly on this unit? That tells the story.
Rating: 5, Review: Put in the pad, plug it in, catch pesky drain flies!
Rating: 5, Review: This worked wonders for fungus gnats! I have tried sticky traps in my plant soil and I've tried mosquito bits. The traps worked a bit but the bits did nothing--this seems to have done the most so far! I've had to get more inserts because it gets gnats so quickly. I think the heat and light attract them most where I am. I will keep getting this as maintenance even when the gnats are gone because the trap doubles as a nice nightlight.
Rating: 5, Review: I've ordered two and they work great.
Rating: 5, Review: I’ve been impressed with how well this works without looking like a gross bug trap. It catches less large flies than I would have hoped but catches everything else! This photo is after having it plugged in for two days.
Rating: 5, Review: Get this! I ordered one and its been good to me! I am getting more for around the house!
Rating: 5, Review: Was actually super surprised to see this thing actually works. I've seen so many influencers promote these and was honestly skeptical. But within 2 or 3 days we had 5 flies on the trap.
Rating: 5, Review: The media could not be loaded. I picked one of these up at a big box store and love it. Found the 2 pack deal on amazon was priced very well. I have 1 in my kitchen, master bath and in the garage. As you can see the garage has attracted loads of bugs. I’m extremely happy not be bothered by these little pests while sleeping
Rating: 5, Review: Works like a charm on our kitchen! Had a fruit fly issue and springtime moths coming in, caught all of them overnight without harsh chemicals!
Rating: 5, Review: Very effective product, with a lot of bugs sticking on the back the first day. However it can’t kill all the bugs…
Rating: 5, Review: It works! Grabs not only gnats but caught a moth and a fly. Just toss the used strip into the trash. Serves as a night light. One in kitchen by back door one in bathroom
Rating: 2, Review: Had this plugged in for 2 weeks and there are less than 10 fruit flies on it and the fruit flies still are out of control in my kitchen! The Terro apple-shaped traps work way better and are way cheaper than these plug-ins. It’s too bad, my sister says she loves these things, but maybe they just don’t work on fruit flies.
Rating: 5, Review: It has worked very well. Placed in kitchen outlet and within minutes, gnats were on there. I had no negative issues.
Rating: 1, Review: Not working … two flies sticked over one night …
Rating: 5, Review: Compared to a more expensive more “sophisticated” trap… photos don’t lie. Caught 3 pesky fat flies, and a bunch of little ones i didn’t even know we had… oh and a mosquito too. Score!
Rating: 5, Review: It comes with one plug and two fly catcher things. It catches them perfectly, the picture is from two days of being plugged in. And the light is really bright so it works as a night light as well!
Rating: 5, Review: I live in a pretty nice apartment in Midtown Manhattan NYC. I’ve had a gnat problem For a while now, where they are just bothersome and very difficult to find where they are originating from. I decided to try this insect trap out because the price was OK and it had good reviews and video. So, in, less than a month this is what accumulated. We’re seeing much less gnats around and being much less bothered by them.
Rating: 4, Review: It’s cool the white part kept falling off :/ but it caught some of the annoying little -
Rating: 5, Review: I live in an area that seems to be impossible to keep bugs out of the house. I have struggled with the sticky fly tapes for years and they don't even work that well. But these are genius and worth every penny. I noticed a huge difference in the amount of bugs over night. It was like magic I went to bed and woke up having to change the sticky pad because it was full of everything from fruit flies to moths I had no idea there were that many in my house. It was gross but it just showed its worth incredibly fast.

Rating: 5, Review: This really works in my kitchen.
Rating: 1, Review: My kitchen is full of flies, hasn't caught a single one
Rating: 5, Review: I was skeptical at first because of the reviews on these types of fly traps. But after 1 week it seems to be doing at least something! We have a really bad gnat problem around our sink and I think I’m finally catching these bastards!
Rating: 5, Review: Does a really good job of catching those annoying little flying pests
Rating: 5, Review: I was super skeptical about this! Plugged it in and in one day, there were 3-4 fruit flys. Crazy!! Bought another for our other room that we see them in. It's bright and also serves as a night light.
Rating: 5, Review: No sabia que tantos animalitos podia haber dentro de mi casa, hasta que empeze a utilizar estos Plugs, me sirvio para moscas, pero mas para las moscas de fruta, despues de dos respuestos mi casa quedo limpia de estos animalitos.

Rating: 1, Review: Flimsy acrylic front and overall lack of quality. After putting my poster in the frame and looking at how bad it made it, I knew that I had to buy another frame.  Only buy if you are willing to be disappointed.
Rating: 1, Review: It’s a shame because the picture frame looks nice visually but the quality of it is very poor. The frame itself is plastic with a cardboard backing and quite flimsy. The “glass piece” that covers the photo is plastic and has a film on both sides of it to protect it? I ordered the gold frame and the gold is VERY yellow. I’m going to use rub n buff to tone down the yellow notes in it. Overall I’m not happy with the purchase… the dollar store carries higher quality frames than this
Rating: 5, Review: Good value for picture frame. not glass- plastic- won't crack. picture looks good in it. thank you.
Rating: 5, Review: The shades of grey varies slightly within the frame giving it a nice rustic look. The frame has a great backing that makes it easy to remove and reinstall. Also has two already installed hooks that makes it easy to hang either vertical or horizontal. It's a good purchase.

Rating: 5, Review: This is the sixth or seventh frame in a variety of sizes that I have purchased from this line. Every single one has been great. They look nice, are super lightweight (only using Velcro command strips lightweight) and look nice. They’re a bit shallower on the wall than a standard glass and wood frame but for my needs, it’s been perfect.
Rating: 5, Review: Nice frames. Good value.
Rating: 2, Review: The quality of the frame is subpar. The frame is flimsy. The “glass” is very thin, not rigid, and easily scratched. The mat is thin and cheap looking. The backing has rivets that poke through and would scratch the back of a full size photo.  Not recommended. Would not buy again.

Rating: 2, Review: I guess I should’ve expected it from the price, but these are very cheap plastic frames. There’s no glass covering, it’s plastic. And of course they put a really sticky sticker on top of that and when you try to scrub it off you get scratch marks all over the plastic… Very disappointed. Probably have to throw them away.

Rating: 5, Review: A good sturdy frame with a secure latching system and just the size I need.
Rating: 2, Review: Honestly, I just think quality of frames in general has gone down over the years. Pictured left is a frame I bought on Amazon during Covid that wasn’t much more expensive. The one pictured right is the one in this listing. The new one is slightly smaller in size even though they were both the listed as the same size. The new one has cheaper materials and backing. I wouldn’t recommend buying this frame if it’s a gift for someone , but if you just want something inexpensive for your house, then go for it.

The color is great and the design is nice as well. My issue is that (and i don’t know if this is because of the hot weather of where I am from) but the ice melts within 2 - 3 hours or less and the water doesn’t stay as cold as I expected.

Rating: 5, Review: My daughter is very happy with her Stanley. I ordered the size smaller than the original tall size. She is soon to be 8 and it is easy for her to hold and use. However, it may not be suitable for children that have a hard time pushing straws up to drink because this one is a bit firm to press up.
Rating: 5, Review: The media could not be loaded. My daughter wanted a Stanley for school but I couldn't see her toting around a 40oz tumbler everyday so this was the perfect alternative. Works great for sports too. Color is just as pictured. Keeps drinks cold all day. Easy to clean.

Rating: 2, Review: I found this sprayer difficult--possibly even dangerous--to use. It either won't hold pressure or sprayed me in the face. The coupling that secures the hose to the body kept loosening which caused a loss in pressure. Annoying. To keep that from happening, I had to turn the coupling until was so tight, it's just a matter of time until it strips out completely as it's only made of plastic. And, when the coupling does manage to stay tight enough to maintain pressure, there's no way to release that pressure until you unscrew something because there's no pressure release valve. I found it difficult to loosen the top without applying a lot of force, which required that I stand right over it to get enough torque. Then, when I finally got the top to turn, the liquid inside sprayed up into my face. Not good! The instructions warned that this might happen, so Chapin is aware of the problem. But, being aware of it still didn't enable me to avoid it--even though I was SUPER careful and tried to. Fortunately I wasn't using a particularly harmful substance, but it's still not good to get sprayed in the eyes and/or mouth with even natural fertilizers or weed killers. All in all, the product design is defective and potentially dangerous.
Rating: 5, Review: Easy to assemble. Looks just like the photo. Great pressure. Used for bug spray. Nozzle long enough to reach under appliances. Very sturdy when full. Happy with my purchase
Rating: 5, Review: I've only used the sprayer twice and so far it's doing what I want.
Rating: 5, Review: We used this for spraying our weeds and it worked perfectly and was super easy to assemble.
Rating: 4, Review: Would have rather had a more adjustable tip but for the price it's good
Rating: 5, Review: I use the sprayer for lawn work, killing weeds and spraying for bugs around the outside of the house. Works well no issues just like it should. Have only had it a couple weeks so can not give a view on how long it lasts but I see no reason if taken care of it will not last for years.
Rating: 5, Review: Happy with this sprayer. Does the job
Rating: 4, Review: This sprayer is a good value for the money. Spray head adjusts well and does not clog or drip when trigger is not depressed. The tank does not have a pressure relief valve which I did not realize before buying - Thus the reason for 4 star review. Otherwise, good sprayer that gets the job done quickly.
Rating: 4, Review: It's a gallon sprayer made in the USA, that's a good start. Where it stumbles, and the reason I took one star off (yeah, maybe a little petty) is that it has markings for 2L, 4L, and 1/2 gallon, but no marking for ONE GALLON on a ONE GALLON sprayer MADE IN THE USA?! WTH? Mind you, a gallon is less than 4L and it had the marking for 4L. I am pretty particular about having precise measurements for the poison being distributed, but I was left to guess how much was an exact gallon. Maybe they should rename it to a 4L sprayer. Otherwise, the sprayer is great.
Rating: 5, Review: it holds pressure sprays fine good value
Rating: 5, Review: So I decided to buy a gallon of the Grass/weeds killer and decided to buy this one gallon sprayer. So far so good I used it today and it does exactly what it needs to do pump a few times and spray. Just be careful with the assembly the pieces feel cheap.

Rating: 1, Review: Does not seal or build any pressure to spray. No matter how tight the top is twisted on, zero pressure builds when pumping and will not spray.
Rating: 1, Review: Worked 6 times then wouldn’t spray with pressure, only drizzle. Aren’t too many hours cleaning and trying to make it function. Nothing worked. Wasted my time. Had my Hudson sprayer for 3 years, always worked well. Only got this one because someone borrowed the Hudson and didn’t return it. Sadly I’m just past the 30 day return window.

Rating: 5, Review: Everything comes out the nozzle just like it was on the picture everything works good
Rating: 1, Review: If you can't pressurize the tank it sort of defeats the purpose

Rating: 4, Review: [No review text available]
Rating: 1, Review: Unfortunately, I did not try to use this for the first time until after the return window was closed. I regret that, because it failed to work the first time we tried to use it. We followed the directions exactly, but while pumping it before trying to spray, the seal around the top leaked and liquid contents sprayed on my husband. We were unable to get it to work at all.
Rating: 1, Review: Literally didn't even last one day. It worked fine the first fill up. The second fill up it wasn't sealing properly. I inspected everything and cleaned off the mating surface and o ring. Still not sealing. Barely put extra pressure on it and the little plastic ears on the pump handle sheared right off. This was one of the cheaper options so I decided to go with it. I guess you get what you pay for. Now I'm out $20 and have a half done project to pick up next weekend. Don't buy this if you value your money or time.

Rating: 5, Review: I liked that this machine was extremely light and easy to move around. My main purpose was to remove small spots or stains. It worked great to remove smudges off the upholstered arms of a chair, as well as the small spots on the area rugs in my home
Rating: 5, Review: The media could not be loaded. Great suction and easy to use!
Rating: 1, Review: I was so excited for this. Reviews seemed great. It was compact and simple. I was ready to go to town on my Stains. This thing is a hunk of junk. You will have better luck with a scrub brush and soap. I tried it on carpets, upholstery, outdoor fabrics, event barstool. Didn’t work on anything. In fact 2 of the stains it made bigger! On top of that, everytime you stop using it, some nasty dirty water leaks out of the brush. I also had leak issues with the unit itself. I wish I was still within the return window. I threw it away after one use. It’s not even worthy of goodwill.
Rating: 2, Review: Product was delivered in a timely manner, but the bag on the main unit was not put on as I would have thought from the factory. I followed directions and filled the tank, but could not get the sprayer to work. Repeatedly resetting the tank and the wastewater receptacle, the sprayer finally started working. After refilling the tank, had to go through the same procedure. If this condition is per design, then the instructions should state that you must have the unit running 5 - 10 minutes prior to cleaning. I am returning the unit.
Rating: 1, Review: Unfortunately, this did not work and was leaking all over the place. First use it was leaking everywhere despite filling correctly and correct setup (this isn’t my first go with steam cleaners). It poured water all through the bottom of the machine, ran along the cord and was puddling before I realized what was happening. I’ve returned and ordered a different one from this manufacturer, no issues with that one.
Rating: 3, Review: I like this product. It's easy to use and it does a great job of cleaning coffee stains out of the carpet but it broke within a year of buying it. The plastic in the handle is not durable enough to last. It still works but I have to hold the pieces together while I use it.
Rating: 3, Review: Handheld dirt/waste contain leaks when it’s locked if you tilt it on its side. Not great when it’s full of dirty liquid. I think it’s missing some type of rubber o ring to make it leak proof. May return this before return period is up

Second, I love the velvet coating because nothing slips off. Truly, remarkable.  Third, they are very sturdy and thin so it easy to pack clothes into smaller closets.  Definitely would recommend.
Rating: 5, Review: I used to use an online brand of this type of hanger with the slip, non-slip velvet covering. When I saw these, I decided to give them a try. They are just as good, maybe better than the other brand which cost more than double! These come in so many colors and quantity varieties too. Im very happy with them. They hold even fairly heavy jackets without warping and the velvet does not transfer to any clothing. Great value!

Rating: 1, Review: I had big hopes for these hangers after reading so many good reviews, but when they arrived, plenty of the hangers had ripped velvet. It was so disappointing. For the small amount of money your are saving, it's not worth it. It's better to spend in little bit more for better quality. Lesson learned.

Rating: 5, Review: Less bulky and keeps my clothes off the floor of my cliset
Rating: 5, Review: I have over 100 of these in my closet and they are perfect for all styles of clothing. The velvet finish prevents dresses and silky tops from sliding off. When not in use, these almost ""magnet"" together to minimize space.
Rating: 3, Review: Used in master closet. Look nice. Only hung up tee shirts and two of the hangers the hook broke off already. Not very sturdy and would not buy again.
Rating: 4, Review: I like these hangers because the velvet keeps the clothes from slipping off. But, I hang my whole outfit on one hanger and occasionally the hook separates from the hanger and can't be repaired. The hangers flex a little to, which makes them feel flimsy.
Rating: 3, Review: These are very flimsy and easy to break. Broke a few before even using it.
Rating: 5, Review: The color a bit dull and off, could have been a nicer shade of grey. They stick, so make sure as soon as you purchase, to seperate them and hang them up, even if you don't plan to use them immediately.
Rating: 5, Review: These hangers are a good deal for what they deliver. No item of clothing will slip off it. Right now I’m hang drying a tank top upside down on the lower part of the hanger. I just have about an inch of overlap and that tank is going nowhere. It’s easy to use. It’s a standard hanger size. It’s attractive in the closet compared to plastic or wire hangers.

Rating: 3, Review: Got 2 of these last year and they have held up well. Ordered two more, however, one came with a severe and unfixable kink on the female end of the hose. Yep, it was shipped that way. Was unable to straighten it out. UPS store is an hour and a half round trip, local UPS drop box is too small for the box, and I don't feel like shelling out an additional 8 bucks for pickup. So I kept it. Bummed about the awful kink that won't go away.

Rating: 5, Review: If you, like me, have experienced the seven hells of bed sheets + cats and just want a cheap piece of fabric to carry you through the next year or two, this is a pretty safe bet for the price point on AMAZON.  It does wrinkle, it will gradually fade from the purchased color after several washes (I chose a dark red and it looks more or less the same now), and it picks up crumbs and pet hair just like everything else. But, importantly, it does so NO WORSE than anything else! And the static is practically nonexistent.

Rating: 4, Review: For the price and the fact that I’ve only had them a free days, I’m super happy with them! They’re nice and soft and they sink in just enough to not be flat and also not be too firm. Will update in awhile to see how they do over the next couple months.
Rating: 3, Review: After several attempts at manual fluffing, and two cycles through the dryer, these pillows don't seem to fluff to their full potential. Certain parts of the pillow seem firmer than others but I can't get them to feel consistent throughout. My head ends up sinking completely to the mattress and leads to my neck being strained. I was exciting to try a different pillow other than my memory foam but this doesn't seem to be the answer.
Rating: 5, Review: Confortable, soft like being in a hotel 5 stars
Rating: 5, Review: My husband just returned from six days in the hospital and while changing our King bed, I found the pillows to be aging. Ordered the new hotel style with the squared of edging and found them to be easier to put the covers on and when he tried his out the first night home, I got so praises for my choice of new comfy pillows the next morning. These are reasonable priced and ever so pleasant to sleep upon.

Rating: 5, Review: It was exactly as I wanted
Rating: 3, Review: If you use them for pillow shams that are just for decoration they are good if you use them to sleep they flatten out
Rating: 5, Review: Packed well in shrink wrap. It only took 20-30 mins for them to fluff up, no odor to them at all. Slept great on this pillow.
Rating: 2, Review: Pillows are very thin and flat, seemingly understuffed. You could probably push all the material inside to one side and it would leave a third of the pillow completely empty. If you normally like to sleep with just one pillow these might work for you because stacked together they make almost one regular pillow, but for anyone who likes to sleep on 2 pillows like me these are too lacking in substance.
Rating: 4, Review: Nice pillows - a little too full - too large for king size pillow cases.
Rating: 3, Review: Inexpensive soft pillow. I will continue to investigate firmer pillow
Rating: 5, Review: Just ok for the price. Not as fluffy as they start out and a little hot after awhile.

It’s a game-changer! Not only does it effectively prevent any accidents from seeping through to the mattress, but it's also comfortable and durable. The waterproof material is a lifesaver, and it's easy to clean, which is a huge plus. Highly recommend for pet owners dealing with similar issues!""

As I am writing this review, I am currently putting off cleaning pee out of my daughter's mattress for the 4th time. If I could 0/5 stars, I would. I cannot stress this enough, it IS NOT WATERPROOF.
Rating: 5, Review: Great waterproof mattress cover that’s breathable, has good padding and is comfortable. Also easy to wash.
Rating: 1, Review: I’m livid!!!! Waterproof my a**!! The mattress got soaked with piss because this protector is completely useless!!!!
Rating: 5, Review: This product works extremely well and I would for sure purchase it again. Considering I have young children, pets, and a husband- you can imagine quickly the bed gets messy. I appreciate that this product truly protects our mattress. It’s super easy to wash+ dry. The only con is how dang good the water proofing is on it. Sometimes I’ll have to do an extra spin and drain because the water would get caught in it like a net. Even with that though I don’t mind it. It’s just proof of how effective it is on the mattress.
Rating: 5, Review: Liked the navy blue color. The fabric and the fact that it's not noisy.
Rating: 5, Review: Does what it’s meant for. Not too thick of a padding but effective. Best bang for your buck.
Rating: 5, Review: Bought for my elderly father. He said it makes the beds warmer and comfortable
Rating: 3, Review: This bedspread is waterproof, but the surface seems to have strong static electricity, and dust sticks to it every day. The key is that you can feel it on your skin and your hair will stick to it!

Rating: 5, Review: You will not be disappointed, it saved my daughter mattress. My grandson had accidentally spill some apple/ grape juice on the bed, but did not get wet or any stains. It also perfectly fit her queen size mattress like a glove and it sleeps cool.
Rating: 5, Review: My passionate and not-at-all-dramatic complaint is that I lovingly selected and ordered the PURPLE mattress protector, but received one that is by absolutely NO stretch of the imagination purple. It's not even lavender. Or periwinkle. Or purple-y grey. It's GREY grey. Not 50 shades of grey, just boring old cement grey. 🥺 And I cannot emphasize enough how much I was looking forward to the beautiful, dark purple mattress cover that would never be visible except between sheet changes. This may seem an unreasonable reaction to some of you cruel and heartless readers, but you see... even when I could not see my beloved purple cover, I would still KNOW it was purple, and that purple-y reassurance would be a ray of light piercing my dismal, colorless existence. But this much-anticipated happiness was TORN from me by whichever stock person thought it was clever to slap that Totally-A-Purple-Matress-Protector sticker onto a Very Obviously Grey mattress protector package. And so, by this lazy person's hand, my dreams of sweet purple pleasure met a bitter end. 💔  Nonetheless, I'll admit this mattress cover has a few redeeming qualities, despite its tragic lack of purple hue... For instance, it fits comfortably and snugly around my very thick mattress + mattress topper combo. It even has plenty of space to spare, should your mattress be even better endowed than mine. And - despite this cover's offensively grey tone - it properly protects my dear mattress from all fluids that threaten to do it harm. It doesn't even crinkle or make any other unpleasant noises when laid on, nor does it reek of chemicals when first removed from the packaging. (Would the purple one have smelled nicer, still? I suppose we'll never know... 😢)  In summary - This is an excellent matress protector. I bought this Should-Have-Been-Purple one + a black queen size one (which did indeed turn out to be black, lol) and I'm quite happy with both. That doesn't mean I won't carry my grudge about the color of this mattress cover to the grave, though. 😂 Alas, if only I weren't too lazy to send this one back and exchange it for an Actually Purple mattress protector. *dramatic sigh*  If you made it this far, you clearly need a hobby. 😂

Rating: 5, Review: It fit perfectly over the mattress, soft material
Rating: 1, Review: I bought these for my toddler son’s first twin size bed. They are remarkably un-waterproof, not even really water resistant. I layer them over a padded mattress cover and it’s always wet underneath if he has a leak. Would not recommend if you expect them to be put to the test.
Rating: 1, Review: My daughter had an accident in her bed and this mattress pad did not work, soaked right through.
Rating: 2, Review: I bought one of these for my king size bed. I was sick of fighting to get ours on the mattress every time we change sheets. I love the fit of this so much that I bought a second one. However they do not keep the pee from getting to the mattress. I am sp disappointed because now my bed smells like pee and the mattress is stained. False advertisement and waste of money. Would not recommend.

Rating: 5, Review: These are great, and hold extremely well!!
Rating: 5, Review: I purchased these because we revamped our bathroom and I was tired of the clutter in the shower. These look beautiful and are very sturdy. I wish they had a solid bottom because smaller or thinner things (foot files, nail brushes, etc) can slip through the bottom. The best part is that I don't have to have extra hooks for loofahs and razors anymore. There are loops on the front that hold those as well. Overall, they work really well, hold a lot of products and are very well adhered to the wall. I would definitely purchase these over and over.
Rating: 1, Review: Worked for a few days. Looked nice too. Then the hooks they hang in broke off the sticky mount.
Rating: 5, Review: Great buy
Rating: 4, Review: Very good quality. Sticks and stays on straight walls. The quality of the baskets are so strong they won’t bend to accommodate the slightest curve in wall. So if you have straight walls go for it.
Rating: 1, Review: *I only used the adhesive pads* Installation was fairly easy and straight forward. Literally just dry the solid smooth area, adhere, hold for 30seconds, wait 24hours before use. Easy. However, a month ago, the first caddy fell off at the adhesive pad. Then thru the week, a second caddy fell off at the hooks and now a third has fallen off at the hooks as well. The caddies look great and seem sturdy, but the adhesive pads are a failure point. Would not recommend.
Rating: 5, Review: I was skeptical of the adhesion of this product, but it is amazing. As far as the reviews of others with rust issues...I applied a coat of clear varnish. So far so good. I would recommend this product.

I love using it for that but I very honestly carry it around all day and use it for so many different reasons. In the morning I use it to dry down my skincare serums, when I'm glazing pottery (I'm a potter) I use it to dry down my glaze, I sit it on my desk and use it while working. We're all obsessed with these. Sincerely maybe the best $15 I've spent on Amazon. I've charged it maybe once in the last two weeks so the battery life is awesome. It's super quiet and I have no complaints!
Rating: 5, Review: I bought this fan for a 3 day musical festival because I knew I would get super hot. Many of my friends made fun of me for spending almost $20 on a baby fan. The first day of the music festival, two people beside me nearly passed out from heat exhaustion and dehydration. I gave them the fan to use and they were both better by the end of the day. Later that night, I unfortunately witnessed a car flip off the interstate. It was dark and we needed flashlights to help the people inside, and luckily enough, this fan has a freaking flashlight!!!! And most recently we had a power outage after a bad storm. And guess what you can use as a portable charger? THIS FAN!!!!!!! Buy it. Just get it. You won’t regret it.

Rating: 3, Review: Fan & charger were great with maybe 2 hours of total charge time for my phone. Fan was strong enough and very portable. Also loved the flashlight but now it barely holds a charge and the fan has stopped working after 2 years so overall decent for a $15 product.
Rating: 5, Review: Works perfectly as intended. Wow, this is amazing. The color is beautiful and soft and gentle, the little bear design is absolutely adorable, it's so useful being a flashlight AND charger AND fan, and it's tiny so it can fit anywhere! The flashlight was surprisingly powerful imo, like not super bright but it isn't weak either. Similarly, the fan was decent. It's what I was most worried about, since it's so small and the blades appear so weak, but it was up to my standards! (And my standards weren't low, either). On a scale of 1-10, if 1 is barely any wind and 10 is about to blow my face off, it sits maybe at a comfortable 6? I think it'll be good enough, it's pretty comfortable. (Allow me to reiterate that 10 is literally ""about to blow my face off,"" which means 9 is somewhere way too strong and 7 and 8 are super strong. This isn't that strong but it is NOT weak). This seems perfect, its versatility is absolutely amazing, it is adorable, and exactly as advertised. I love this product so much!!

Rating: 5, Review: Works like a charm.
Rating: 5, Review: My sis and I both use these ... we are of hot flash age :) I keep one in the kitchen, one on my desk, and one on the nightstand. She also keeps one in her purse as these are really handy for when you're having a hot flash at a restaurant or in the store, etc.
Rating: 5, Review: I have several of these and they are the best that I have found. Don't shop around, buy this one!
Rating: 5, Review: Was at a grandson’s concert and it was very warm. I pulled my little fan out and turned it on. Instant relief! It was very quiet but powerful and cooled me down. Several other women asked where they could get one. I would highly recommend this little fan!
Rating: 5, Review: Tricky at first but it comes with very clear directions and it’s great! It comes with a charger as well. The airflow is nice!!! It even has two settings. Perfect to keep in your purse as well.
Rating: 5, Review: Ok, this little fan can put out some air! Easy to charge, easy to carry in a purse because of how small it is, and it gets the job done. I bought to take with me to Houston, TX where it is super humid, and it got the job done!

Rating: 3, Review: Not sure if mine is defective But I can’t open it  This was what I wanted for Christmas It was the only thing on my Christmas gift and no one would buy for me I got a bunch of junk instead. Sorry but I only wanted this So in 2 days is my birthday so I purchased 3 tiny gifts for myself this being one of them but I can’t open it  I’m so hurt and disappointed I may order a replacement hoping I can open that One
Rating: 2, Review: Fan works nice but the flashlight doesn’t work even after charging it for 24hrs
Rating: 5, Review: This little fan is fantastic. I bought it for a trip to Spain with my sister. I am ALWAYS too hot, and I hate being hot. I used this every day of the week long trip, including at the airports, in taxis, at restaurants and while walking. It is so small it fit easily in my small travel purse and on any of the small cafe tables used at meals. It is not noisy so I felt comfortable using it in every setting. The cover bends back to act as a stand. It held a charge well and was quick to recharge. Highly recommend for fellow hot ladies!

The charging light went from a slow steady blink to an erratic flash, even though the limited instructions that are included say the light will stop flashing after the charge is complete, so I knew I had a problem. (I did use the correct 5 amp charger). Since the instructions do not say thing about an erratic flashing light, I decided to scan the QR code printed on the instructions. Well, I received an error showing that page cannot be found. Ok, I'll just search for my scale on their website and download the instructions. Wait, this model isn't listed on their website. This stinks, I guess I'll call their toll-free support line. No way, they aren't taking calls, and they want me to message them. Sure, I'm already pretty invested into this, so I'll start an online chat. Seriously, their online chat is telling me to call their toll free support number, the same number that told me to message them! After I had this problem, I did a search of the reviews and found this is not an isolated incident. I am returning this scale will not purchase any more items from Etekcity based on the fact they clearly do not support the customer.
Rating: 5, Review: Officially has a permanent home on our countertop
Rating: 5, Review: Love the accuracy and ease of use. Great addition to my kitchen and makes tracking food so easy.
Rating: 2, Review: T'his scale did not detect the small foods I placed on it. I couldn't use it.
Rating: 5, Review: Received and scale was ready for immediate use right out of the box. Well worth the money.
Rating: 5, Review: I bought this to make sourdough but have ended up using it for so many other things. From weighing protein to making homemade skincare. I like that it has different metric settings.
Rating: 5, Review: I follow the Blueprint diet recommended by Bryan Johnson, which requires precisely measured portions, and this scale has enabled me to easily measure out the macro parts of those portions. It's easy to use, the readout clear, and it's easy to clean. I use it every day and I really like it.
Rating: 1, Review: This thing is always been relatively imprecise, but not even a year after I purchased it, it’s completely broken. It’s weighing everything currently at about double the actual weight. Tried clearing it out resetting it nothing works.
Rating: 5, Review: Works as it should!
Rating: 3, Review: The app is a little wonky, there are certain foods you can not weight. Milk or Creamers can only be added in by Tbsp so that is a little annoying. I only use the scale for measuring food and then tracking it in the LoseIt app. I would say if you are using MyFitnesspal app, Loseit app or Cronometer app just use a cheaper scale it's not worth the money.
Rating: 4, Review: This scale was just what I was looking for for my kitchen. It is light and compact for easy storage. Very easy to use and came with directions. The scale is also easy to wipe clean when your finished. It looks great like stainless steal.

Rating: 5, Review: My wife loves this thing. It makes recording her meals a lot easier. If you’re into weighing your food this scale is great. If not, it’s still a good digital scale.
Rating: 5, Review: The Etekcity Digital Kitchen Scale, Model EK6015, has all th features I want and need along with a great price, compared to other kitchen scales. It's rechargeable, waterproof, can be zeroed, provides weights in several different units, and can be recharged. It looks good, too. I don't need the scale to do anything else, so I am very happy with it.
Rating: 1, Review: I did extensive testing with this scale and it’s not correct .. it measured less than the weight that was suppose to be.. I have 2 other scales 🤨😫
Rating: 4, Review: The product is very light if compare from my experience. When press units or reset the weight, it move or lift one side up sometime. But it work well so far.
Rating: 2, Review: It was just too small
Rating: 4, Review: This is a very useful item..helps in making proper measurements..
Rating: 5, Review: Easy to use. Easy to use a bowl and deduct the weight and measure only contents. I'm on a special diet and this is my greatest purchase in a long time.
Rating: 5, Review: It is good. It does good,seems made good too. I would recommend
Rating: 5, Review: Does need mush space and easy to use.
Rating: 5, Review: Love that I've finally found a consistent accurate scale I can use while meal prepping for my family!
Rating: 1, Review: I know this is a budget scale, but it stopped working after 2 years of occasional use. The display flashes until the batteries are removed and then put back in. It works fine after that but is a bit of a pain to constantly do.
Rating: 5, Review: Perfect for weighing out bread dough for buns, etc.
Rating: 5, Review: I've been using this kitchen scale for 7 years now. It's probably been long enough to leave a review, right? Anyways, this scale is perfect. There is no better kitchen scale under $100; much less under $20. It is perfect for the kitchen, and I also use it a TON for weighing stuff for postage. It's not going to be ideal for weighing anything under food and mail.. so if you're looking for a scale for very small increments of powders or herbs, this is not the one you want. If you're wanting to save stamps or to measure your portions; this one has been used regularly for 7 years by me and still gets two thumbs up
Rating: 5, Review: Wife loves it!
Rating: 5, Review: Finally, I am getting serious about portion-control. I am amazed at what a real serving size looks like. This scale seems to be accurate as I have not compared it to other scales that I own. Once I do, I will update this review. The scale is smaller than I thought, but there is still room to place a small bowl or container on it for weighing your food. So far, no problems.
Rating: 5, Review: I love the lighting, the charge last a while, weighs items well. Love the size for storage.

It serves its purpose. My main complaint is that it has an extra hole at the top than the standard pack of hooks. It makes it look/hang strangely. Also, it is advertised to come with hooks. I bought 2 of these curtains and NEITHER came with hooks. I didn't bother returning though, but would buy elsewhere next time.
Rating: 1, Review: Cheap light weighted plastic shower curtain way too long in length and weights were a joke as there was no weight to them. I didn't return because I couldn't get wrapped up to ship back.
Rating: 5, Review: Love a fabric liner over plastic. It was blowing back in on me but I added weights bought here on Amazon and both products are excellent!
Rating: 5, Review: I like the thickness and nontoxic , no toxic smell. The weight is good. I like the color aqua. It hangs nice and dries rather quickly after a shower which is good. So far no issues. I would recommend this.
Rating: 5, Review: I’m quite pleased with this item. I don’t believe it will stain very easily.
Rating: 3, Review: This liner is way too thick. It gets jumbled on itself and doesnt move well with the curtain. Go with the medium.

Rating: 4, Review: cheap
Rating: 2, Review: Buy one that is not so thick so it can bend and adhere to the shower stall walls.
Rating: 5, Review: Effective product
Rating: 5, Review: I got the 3D clear pebble pattern 8G thickness. I am using this as a shower curtain liner along with an outer fabric shower curtain. The pebble pattern looks great and is prettier than a plain clear curtain. I chose the 8G thicknesses because I am using in conjunction with a fabric shower curtain. Previously, I have used a thicker plastic curtains but they are too thick and stiff. It makes it harder to move the curtain along the curtain rod. With this curtain, I can effortlessly open and close the curtain. Also, I want to mention that the magnets along the bottom of the curtain work just like they should. They are not strong magnets, but that is intentional. If that were strong, it would make the curtain hard to open and close and would eventually cause you to tear the curtain. I typically change these plastic curtains every year or two, and I intend to buy another one too keep as a future replacement.
Rating: 2, Review: It is a very hard plastic and cannot easily make flap when hanging.
Rating: 2, Review: Not very happy with it. It’s very thin and blows around when showering. You have to watch it that it’s not letting water run onto the floor. I won’t keep it long.
Rating: 5, Review: Outstanding quality!
Rating: 1, Review: I got the 10g shower curtain and had such high hopes for it. I hate the cold shower curtain liner blowing into while showering and thought this would be the solution. However, I was sorely mistaken and extremely disappointed. The magnets are flimsy and don’t stick to the tub at all. The liner bellows and sticks to me making it uncomfortable to shower. Even with a curved shower curtain rod, water still manages to get through and soak my bathroom floor. Overall this product isn’t much better than a $2 shower liner you can get from Walmart
Rating: 2, Review: I was very disappointed with this 8gauge shower curtain liner. The description states it is a heavyweight liner, however, it is so thin that it sticks to my body during my shower. The 3 magnets DO NOT STICK to the fiberglass tub. I do like the frosty style. I don't recommend this product if you are looking for a heavyweight liner.
Rating: 1, Review: Don’t waste your money! This is not worth ruining your nice shower by fighting with a shower curtain that is supposed to cling to the side of the tub and not to you!!! So frustrating!!
Rating: 1, Review: correct, it doesn't smell, but its cheap, thin plastic. I give it about a month before it's in the trash. I usually use a fabric liner. I don't know why I thought this would be better. Oh, and you can't return it. So, im stuck with this POC.
Rating: 5, Review: I like that it is see through and easy to clean. It keeps my floor dry and my dog can peak and see me.
Rating: 5, Review: I ordered the 10G frosted shower liner and it’s nice. It’s a bit stiff, which I assume means it’s a heavier duty curtain. It does tend to blow in a little during a shower, but I don’t have a metal tub for the magnets to stick to. Not the manufacturers fault. Overall, keeps the water in the shower, which is what it’s supposed to do.

Rating: 5, Review: When I ordered this chopper I thought that it might not be very sturdy. But, I was wrong. It is very sturdy. I make alot of soups and it has cut my prep time in half. I use it for celery, carrots and onions. It does a great job. I highly recommend it.
Rating: 4, Review: Plastic parts don’t hold. They break and have to be glued to keep working.
Rating: 5, Review: Works great
Rating: 4, Review: Top part cracked no way to replace that part only without having to rebuy everything
Rating: 5, Review: I’ve tried many of these and this is by far the best I’ve tried. Great for summer salads.
Rating: 5, Review: Yes - if you have to dice up anything, you need this... it works great and seems durable - I'm not bashful - I put apple slices on and BAM! - I now have apple cubes for salad. When I say BAM! - I mean I slam it down... I dinged it one star on easy to clean since it's not really 'easy'.... but anything with crossed blades like this isn't going to be 5-stars...  I recommend this to make meal prep faster!
Rating: 4, Review: Not a fan of the spiral slicer wish it had a flat blade for slicing
Rating: 4, Review: Not as easy to use as I thought but still works cool for soft veggies. Not potatoes
Rating: 5, Review: I bought this item because I am not very good at eating my vegetables and I thought that if I had an easy way to chop them for salads, etc. I would eat more. This little chopper is amazing! I can now make a salad in just a few minutes and eat it right out of the base of this chopper. It chops it all right into the base. You just mix it up, add dressing and seeds/croutons and you have a quick meal. I even folded up some deli meat and chopped it into the salad. Clean up was a breeze too. It comes with a brush and a little device to get food out of the crevices, 2 choppers, and 2 slicers. Dishwasher safe. Don't hesitate to purchase if you are looking for a quick, easy way to chop fruits and veggies.
Rating: 5, Review: Nice sharp blades, comes with a couple of cleaning brushes, excellent time saver
Rating: 4, Review: Be careful using this, I cut myself three times the first time. I don’t want to put it in the dishwasher cause I’m afraid it will dull the blades. So I don’t like that I have to hand wash it. It does a great job cutting up onions
Rating: 1, Review: This POS lasted less than a year before the cheap Chinese plastic pieces snapped off, rendering it useless
Rating: 3, Review: I bought this on the strength of the reviews. It really is a good piece of gear - when new. Chops everything from onions to herbs in one push as long as you keep the thickness reasonable. I found I had to hand wash the metal chopper ""grids"" and the plastic pusher plate. Stuff gets down in and doesn't come out in the dishwasher. That's not a complaint; just an observation.  Unfortunately, my example was not durable, and I don't think I was too demanding at one or two uses per week. The ""basin"", the lid and the chopper blade inserts - yes. The hinges and clips that make the whole thing work - not at all. I don't know where the clip that keeps the blade assembly in place went - by the 2nd or 3rd use, it was gone. The spring/hinge assembly at the back is super weak. One side fell out after a month or so. and I had to keep putting it back in every use. The other side crapped out last night - the pieces snapping in half and the spring ricocheting across the kitchen to become an instant kitten toy (it's under the fridge now).  Worked well while it lasted, but it didn't last very long. I won't replace it - as designed/manufactured, the same thing will happen again,
Rating: 5, Review: Why didn’t I know about this sooner? No more crying over slicing onions. Super sharp blades. Chops through potatoes and peppers like butter. Great quality, should last for many years. I love this.
Rating: 5, Review: I really like how safe this is, my kids can use it and I don't need to worry about them getting hurt. Easy to use and big time saver. Durable and easy to clean. I've had mine for a couple years now and have no complaints, still works as good as the first day.
Rating: 5, Review: I tried two veggie choppers from my Walmart ($14 slap-chop and $20 similar to this style) that couldn't handle an onion, or a tomato, or a bell pepper. It was frustrating, so I saw this thing on Amazon (after a link from a Buzzfeed article), and it friggin' chops through all of those! You give it a good hard push down and BAM, you got veggie bits (two size grids) in a nice big container, fits all the goods. I should have made salsa. And it comes with cleaning tools if you don't have a dishwasher, and a spiralizer that I haven't tried yet. I got the 4 in 1 for $24 and sometimes wish I'd gone for the larger sets.
Rating: 1, Review: At first, it was working fine!! Then one day we noticed pieces of plastic - black plastic like the chopper, in our food!!! Initially we chalked it up to misplacement but NOPE. Even when we placed it right, pieces of plastic would end up in our food!!!!!!!!!! Just outright awful!!!
Rating: 5, Review: Cuts the work in half. I love this thing.
Rating: 5, Review: Loving my onions now because it’s so easy to chop without tearing….
Rating: 5, Review: If the vegetables are sliced thin enough, this works perfectly. If slices are a little too thick, you have to force it closed. Cleaning it sometimes involves a toothpick, or a knife, (something thin and sharp) to get pieces out of the crevices.
Rating: 5, Review: I have not gotten to use it yet but my husband loves this thing and he uses it for all his salads which is pretty much daily.
Rating: 5, Review: Wash and cube/cut your veggies or fruits first to make it easy to chop chop. You can use the container as the salad bowl. Makes a surprisingly large salad so be careful how much you add in. Tad difficult to clean the top part that pushes the food through the sharp grates. The grates are VERY VERY sharp, do be careful.
Rating: 3, Review: What I did receive works great, however the peeler, large dicer, spiralizer, and finger guard were missing.

Rating: 5, Review: My husband bought me a new horse trailer for Christmas this past year. Now that we're coming into rodeo season I decided it was time for my to buy a mattress for the trailer. My husband, as loving as he is, wanted me to buy an air mattress. I have enough back problems as it is so there is NO WAY I was going to buy an air mattress. He couldn't complain when I told him I found this one for $83 so I ordered it and gave it a try. It arrived 3 days sooner than estimated and was easy to unpack and unroll. I let it sit and ""puff up"" for a few hours (not as long as recommended because I'm impatient). I could not believe how great it felt! First rodeo isn't until next weekend so I can't attest to how a full night's sleep will be but the nap I took on it just for quality control purposes and it was fantastic! Well worth the price and exactly what I wanted.
Rating: 5, Review: Great for budget, great for sleeping, great all-around product! I am picky about my mattresses. I have bone and muscle pain (chronic). So far, this mattress is sooooo comfy! So inexpensive! So easy-peasy to deal with. I unwrapped it, put it in a room with window open, turned on the ceiling fan counterclockwise and let the mattress air out and expand. No smell. So far, I am totes psyched about this purchase!
Rating: 5, Review: This is one of the most comfortable mattresses
Rating: 5, Review: The media could not be loaded. Firm to Soft and good so far, just got it. A little bigger than my Walmart twin size (bottom mattress, but still good. Stability is good.

Not sure how I would’ve known this before hand so it’s not the vendors fault. But I’m terms of performance worst sleep experience for me. My husband on the other hand is comfortable.

Rating: 5, Review: The media could not be loaded. I bought this mattress and was absolutely shocked with how comfortable it really is. It comes in a box, rolled up and then you unravel it and set it out for 72 hours as recommend to assure it's true form. It was to it's true form though within 24 hours. I bought the 8 inches thinking I would rather be safe and make sure it was comfortable enough since you can't try it before hand when ordering something online verse in person. It's also very supportive and I woke up feeling refreshed after sleeping on it. I can safely say if I didn't know the price of this mattress, I would definitely think it's much more expensive because the great quality of it. It really shocked my expectations and also exceeded them! You can't beat the price for the quality and I definitely highly recommend this product!

Rating: 3, Review: Very nice mattress but definitely not as thick as it is in the picture. But I probably wouldn’t have bought it is it show the true thickness in the picture.
Rating: 3, Review: I have no idea this mattress was going to be this hot while trying to sleep, which would probably be fine for the winter months. but, summer is on its way. so I'm not so sure this is going to be a good mattress for the summer months. it's comfortable, seems to be well made. but somewhere, somehow, this mattress is not a cool mattress to sleep on. in fact, not cool at all. I was very disappointed in the fact that it's so hot to sleep on. unfortunately, there is no way to return this mattress. you will never ever get it back in its original packaging or the Box that it came in.so with that said, you are just kind of stuck with it. I guess other than that their was no smell with the mattress at all. if I had of known it was so hot, I probably would not have purchased it due to the fact that it would be impossible to return
Rating: 5, Review: I ordered a 10 inch king and its so soft and I thought 10 inches was to short but it is really thick and soft, it is firm but at the same time you sink into it. I recommend it and for this low price it is more than 100% worth it. TRUST
Rating: 5, Review: Thank you! Is a great product and very well delivered!
Rating: 5, Review: We got another mattress before this one that was more expensive. Thankfully our dog peed on it and put us out of misery. So we bought this cheap one as a replacement, it is so much nicer!

They are super soft and not hot to sleep on. I love the different colors they come in I got the sage green and lavender set.  Those one of the pillow cases did fell apart after the first few washings, but I am not to upset about that.
Rating: 5, Review: I purchased the white kings size sheets. I love how they cover the full mattress. I don’t have to worry about the corners coming off of the mattress. Very soft . Honestly best sheets I have ever owned. Very easy to wipe off stains. Pockets on pillow cases are the best. First time I have pillow cases with pockets, super in love . I will definitely be buying more colors.

Rating: 5, Review: Finally, some sheets that fit my 14-inch deep mattress at a reasonable price. I (m-77) sleep very hot, often having night sweats even in a cold room. These sheets seem to breath much better than the 100% cotton sheets that I have been using. This summer will put them to the test & I will update this review if the experience is less than expected.

Rating: 3, Review: I ordered 2 sets of queen sheets and received them quickly. They were packaged in the clear zipper packs as sheet sets usually are, both with a paper insert with the manufacturers name and Queen printed on it. I went to place the sheets on 2 queen beds and one fit well but the other was over a foot too short. Maybe it's a full size? Anyway, disappointed since I let them sit in my linen closet for 4 months before using them can't return it.
Rating: 3, Review: This is the second set of these sheets we have purchased. The first one we ordered was a dark very set and had no problems. This blue set arrived, nothing was wrong with the packaging but the corner was not sewn properly and had come undone. I have sewing experience so I just fixed them myself instead of going through the return hassle. We do like the feel of the sheets. The are soft and hold up well with our dog and cats. They have pretty deep pockets so there's no fighting to get them on the mattress.

Then they starts to stretch out and don't fit snug on the mattress. They are very wrinkly. Wishing I would have just spent more money and purchased higher quality sheets!
Rating: 2, Review: I ordered two sets of queen sheets. Unfortunately one of them was incorrectly marked and ended up being a king set….which wasn’t discovered until after being opened and washed. Sigh. The sheets that fit are fine thus the 3 start but I’m out half the order.

Rating: 4, Review: Very effective
Rating: 1, Review: After spraying it I had more gnats than before & small green little spiders I have never seen before. I gave it about 2 weeks just to see if anything would change but it just got worse with the bugs. I will say that the wasps never came back I was thinking it was because of the smell since they came & went fairly quicker than usual. I would take a picture or video but since we had massive tornados for the past few days the bugs were gone
Rating: 4, Review: Sprayed my rose bush for avids. They went away, but came back. Sprayed a second time and they're gone now. Organic, safe for the environment.
Rating: 5, Review: I tried everything from Mint, to spearmint! Once I sprayed this on my plants as well as the dirt, no more gnats or fruit flies anywhere! I love this product and will also purchase a bottle for the office. I highly recommend but be careful not to spray on delicate plants as it might be too strong, for example my Oxalis purple clover plant is too delicate for the spray.
Rating: 5, Review: I’ve been using this once a week for my phone problem and it’s helping a ton. I think consistency is key here but nothings touched the bugs until I started using this neem oil. The sprayer sprays wide so it’s very easy to use and I’ll be purchasing more when this runs out.

Rating: 5, Review: I never runs out of this neem oil product. Part of my plant care. I have healthy plants.

Soft, crispy, cool yet warm. Love these sheets. Tossing my others and getting another set.
Rating: 5, Review: These sheets are really nice and feel good. The fit my adjustable bed/mattress very well. This was a very good buy, price and quality. They washed very good. Of course I have only used them once because I've had them for a couple of weeks.
Rating: 1, Review: I hated them. They kept bunching up, coming off the corners, took them off after one night and bought better sheets. You get what you pay for
Rating: 5, Review: I bought these queen sheets for a present to myself. They did not disappoint. The color is gorgeous. They are the softest sheets. They continue to look awesome each and every time I wash and dry them. I’m going to buy the navy color next time.
Rating: 5, Review: Love the look and feel extremely soft looks great
Rating: 5, Review: Had these for about a month and so far so good!
Rating: 3, Review: Poor quality fabric that snags if you so much as brush against it. Vibrant color, soft feel that is warmer than cotton but not as warm as flannel. Good for chilly spring weather. Glad the set was on sale because it will look awful by this time next year and we will put it in the bin.
Rating: 5, Review: In my opinion they are Great quality! Soft and affordable sheets!
Rating: 5, Review: I ALWAYS purchase Mellanni sheets. In my opinion, they are the most soft, durable, wrinkle-free sheets you can buy. The price is reasonable and doesn't break the bank to sleep.
Rating: 5, Review: These sheets are very soft yet wrinkle free. The size fits our deep mattress well, and the pillowcases are more than generous in size to fit oversized pillows.
Rating: 5, Review: Seems a little small when I washed them, always a challenge when you are ordering king sheets. Washed up nicely, dryer low setting, minimal wrinkles. Pleased with the quality for the price.
Rating: 3, Review: The sheets are soft but thin. They don’t stay on the corners. I have a king with a very large and thick mattress and the sheets are still too big.
Rating: 5, Review: Speedy shipping, super soft sheets, 3rd set of these sheets. Highly recommend this seller!
Rating: 1, Review: Bought these based on all the influencer recommendation and all the reviews and these are soft but pilled up right away. SO uncomfortable now. Kept them because I had used and washed and threw out all packaging. You were warned!!
Rating: 3, Review: I like the new sheets. The design is beautiful. However, the pillow cases have the hem not sewn tight, both cases are coming apart.
Rating: 5, Review: My folks have these on their guest bed & I couldn't wait to get them. Maybe because I got the black ones (since u should sleep in total darkness) my old white ones pick up light in room, but saw I small stain, dont know what from poss my dog? probably wouldn't notice on any other color, so left a 4, they are good for not having dog hair stick which is good. No wrinkles. also matches my dust ruffle I just ordered on Amazon so now matches my border collie!

Rating: 5, Review: I love the product. It looks so much better than the plastic liner I was using!
Rating: 5, Review: Easy to wash soft to touch
Rating: 2, Review: I've been an avid user of fabric shower curtains for years, and love their durability vs. plastic..... I typically keep a couple on hand and routinely wash them after 2-4 weeks of use, anticipating that they'll last several years. I bought this fabric one as a replacement to my ""hard water stained"" liners and was a bit disappointed at the flimsy/thin fabric. Although it's priced well, I expect I'll buy a more expensive version to get a thicker more durable fabric liner.

Rating: 5, Review: My husband and I are very hard to please when it comes to candles scents. This one ranks as our all time favorite. It has a soft scent that isn’t overpowering, yet fills the room with a calming, heavenly smell.
Rating: 5, Review: Smells great.
Rating: 1, Review: CAME BROKEN WITH GLASS ALL OVER THE PLACE. JUST THROWN IN THE BOX TO ROLL AROUND WITH NO SUPPORT, PAID OVER $30 DOLLARS FOR A BROKEN CANDLE FROM YANKEE. YANKEE SHOULD BE ASHAMED OF THEMSELF. NOT ACCEPTED IN THIS DAY. VERY DISAPPOINTED IN A COMPANY AS WELL KNOWN AS YANKEE.
Rating: 1, Review: I have never been a fan of Yankee candles. This is proof why I contacted them immediately after I retrieve my package from the door. I have not heard back from them. I bought the two to get the deal some deal. This candle is not usable, and Yankee candles has yet to respond to my complaint. I retrieved it right after it was left at the door, so I guess it melted in the hot truck. I would not suggest buying these, especially if you live in a warm climate.
Rating: 4, Review: I love candles, esp . Yankee Candles. I never used this scent before, but I decided to buy it because my granddaughter loves pink and I use it under my candle warmer. The candle is a pretty pink, not my decor, but I didn’t buy it for that. I put it under my candle warmer and it is a very subtle scent. I wish it had a stronger smell, as it is a different smell than I usually buy. The description says floral, but it really has more of a citrus smell. I don’t think I would purchase this scent again as I like a stronger scent and that is why I buy Yankee Candles, They usually have a a stronger scent in the room.
Rating: 5, Review: I've been purchasing Yankee Candles for years now. Why? Their scents are strong and don't smell waxy. The candle itself lasts a very long time. You can purchase the cheap 3 for $10 candles at Michaels but they don't have the strong lasting scent nor do they burn for long. The wax in these doesn't puddle up around the wick, a common problem with some candles. This causes the flame to be extinguished. When the candle burns down too low to light anymore I use a candle/coffee warmer to continue to enjoy the scent for many more days. I have a supply of these candles on hand at all times and will always buy them.
Rating: 5, Review: It's a Yankee Candle so you know it's going to be good. Be sure to only burn for a few hours at a time, and keep the wick trimmed.
Rating: 5, Review: Just a few of the Yankee Candle Scents are my favorite because they really fill the room with scent. Most do not unless it is a very small room. Lilac is one of those. Macintosh Apple and Harvest are 2 others.
Rating: 5, Review: The scent is there until the end, unlike the lesser priced look-a-likes.
Rating: 5, Review: This is a great scent. It’s a mix of a light fruit scent with fresh air. Hard to describe. I love it so much I bought another one for a friend.
Rating: 1, Review: I can’t get the wick to stay lit. If it did actually do that I’m sure it would smell Great but it’s a pretty useless candle. Save your money and buy Sonoma candles. They are cheaper and better smell and no issues staying lit
Rating: 5, Review: Love this scent! It is not too strong but it still gives a clean beachy smell to the house. It also doesn’t burn too quickly either, it lasts awhile! My go to candle I buy it every time! I can’t ever find it anywhere except Amazon.

I'm a huge fan of YC, I've bought hundreds through the years, and this is one of my favorites. This is a candle best suited for open/larger areas. That's just because it's so strong. It really smells like lilac flowers.
Rating: 5, Review: Has a great smell both when it's burning and when it's not.

Rating: 5, Review: Perfect size & nice quality!
Rating: 3, Review: I needed several pillow inserts for a special project. They aren't horrible, but I'm using them for people sitting on the floor, and they aren't as fluffy or supportive as I had hoped. Then again, they were inexpensive, so this is a case of you get what you pay for. Since I will only be using them a few times a year, I can live with them, but if I wanted them for use more often, I'd have invested in a better quality.

Rating: 5, Review: I bought these and couldn’t find the right pillow covers, so these sat in the package until after the return policy expired. About two months, later I found covers and unboxed these pillows. I waited for them to fluff up for a few days and unfortunately they are very flat! I even bought a smaller size pillow cover, so I could get the nice pillow chop effect, but nada! The pillows don’t even fill out the smaller size case which is shocking! 😳 don’t recommend!!!!

Rating: 5, Review: Great product to keep bugs away!
Rating: 1, Review: I had read reviews and thought this would work great to help with mosquitoes and the bugs. So I went ahead and bought 3… I shouldn’t have. There are no returns and I used one bottle on the yard and it did absolutely nothing . A complete waste of money . The reviews on this one fooled me unfortunately
Rating: 1, Review: REVIEW FOR THE CUTTER ECLIPSE ZONE MOSQUITO REPELLENT DEVICE Let me first say I dislike when companies put more than one very different product on their listing. It combines all the reviews for the various items into one place, which makes it incredibly difficult to find the reviews for the one product you are interested in.  In spite of it being difficult to find reviews specific to the ECLIPSE ZONE MOSQUITO REPELLENT DEVICE, I went ahead with the purchase. I really wanted this to work. It seemed like the best, most economical option.  Sadly, the item I received looked used. As in someone purchased it, used it, didn't like it, and returned it. Then it was sold to me for the brand new price.  The warning sticker on the outside of the unit was peeling off. It appeared to have been removed and then replaced, but the adhesive was no longer holding it in place.  Also, the repellent bottle was less than half full. Certainly not up to the level shown in the product photos.  Despite that, I wanted this thing to work, and figured if it did, the sticker and low fluid would be a small price to pay in exchange for a working mosquito repellant. Except it didn't work. Mosquitos continued to buzz around me and the so-called repellent device, inches away from it. The instructions say to allow 10 minutes for effectiveness. I gave it close to half an hour each, two evenings in a row, before they chased me inside and I gave up.  What does work is my 20 year old bottle of Avon Skin So Soft. I was trying to avoid using sprays every time I wanted to sit out on my deck, but if that is what works, that's what I'll do. This thing was a waste of money.
Rating: 5, Review: Very effective and easy to use.
Rating: 5, Review: I’ve used this Cutter backyard spray for a couple of years now. I usually spray the yard in May and again around the end of August. Those pesky gnats never bother me with this stuff around. Recommended!
Rating: 5, Review: I only use this on my grass. I keep it off my fruit trees, grapes, veggies, and blackberries, Anything that is going to attract bees. Works great for fleas, ticks, and ground born mosquitos. My dogs appreciate that.
Rating: 5, Review: This is a miracle especially during southern summers.
Rating: 5, Review: This bottle takes awhile to go thru, only used half the bottle to cover almost a full acre! So far so good.
Rating: 3, Review: Not sure if it's supposed to eliminate the flea's and ticks but they still there, although not as bad. Trying a second bottle, I'll let ya knows how that goes.
Rating: 5, Review: Applied this product two weeks ago and I have seen a significant change in the mosquitos in my yard! Very easy to spay over the yard. I will definitely be purchasing this again!

Rating: 1, Review: I bought 3 bottles due to the great reviews for my self and family members. I sprayed the backyard and front yard twice and it seemed to work for a day after that we started to get mosquito bites again. My family member had the same experience. I wouldn’t recommend.

No bending or kneeling. It really pulls the weed down to the root. Its a good deal for the price. I would recommend it to others.
Rating: 5, Review: We had a yard full of dandelions and this makes it easy to extract them.
Rating: 5, Review: It works exactly as advertised. It is lightweight and the ejector is well worth the extra cost. This is amazing!
Rating: 5, Review: This really does work like they say it does. You still have to stoop over a bit, but not like pulling by hand. I have really back knees so can kneel, and my back is not so hot either (hey, I'm an old lady) so anything that I can do to clear some of the bigger weeds out of my butterfly garden without using chemicals is a win in my book.
Rating: 5, Review: Great on any weeds! I'm a 60 year old woman and have been gardening all my life. I typically sit on a small plastic step stool to hand weed, but the arthritis in my hands makes pulling weeds difficult sometimes. This tool eliminates all that. Pop it in over the weed and pull the handle back and the weed comes out with ease. The only thing I would say is use it early in the season before the long taproot weeds like dandelion and burdock get too big, otherwise you'll just be snapping the root off. It worked wonderfully on clumps of grass in my flower beds.
Rating: 5, Review: Take the route out
Rating: 1, Review: If you have underground rocks of any size, shrub and tree roots or even if the ground is hard, this tool will be useless. A hand weeder will let you wiggle it to where you can find places to dig. I really wanted this tool to work like in the video . The video showed the conditions needed to work - lawn grass, level.
Rating: 1, Review: Doesn’t work well and is awkward.
Rating: 5, Review: It’s Amazing! I enjoy weeding, but I went to town with this tool!!!
Rating: 5, Review: I have always hated weeding. Although, it was gratifying when you had a nice weed free lawn. BUT after receiving this, I find myself going outside looking for weeds. I'm not sure if I'm doing that because I now enjoy weeding or if I'm doing it to see who will win - the weed or the weeder. This has far exceeded my expectation. Bring on the weeds...I'm ready for them!
Rating: 4, Review: THE ONLY PROBLEM SO FAR IS KNOCKING THE WEEDS OFF AFTER THEY GET DUG UP. MAYBE THIS IS A TRY AND LEARN PROCESS.
Rating: 5, Review: Wasn't sure if it would handle crabgrass very well....but it did!! It works so well, don't think I could live without it. There was no assembly, just took it out of the box and started using it. Very sturdy, don't feel like it's going to break on hard to get out weeds. Weeds come out quick and easy. Was able to fill six - 5 gallon buckets in no time! Yard has never look so good! If your on the fence on getting this. I would urge you to. It will become your favorite tool too!
Rating: 5, Review: I don’t mind pulling weeds now. Easy to use and no bending over. Pulls all the roots of the weeds. I recommend the one with 4 teeth.
Rating: 5, Review: Really pulls up complete root. Watch how to use video really makes a difference.
Rating: 5, Review: Love it. Saves my back and knees
Rating: 2, Review: It's stated to be a stand up weed puller, at best a bend over tool. This causes back pain. I ordered a stand up and no way I could stand up. 39"" is too short. Should be at least 52"".
Rating: 4, Review: Light and easy to use. I like the ejection feature. It works best on taproot weeds like dandelions. Its not going to do a great job on grassy weeds or those without a central root clump.
Rating: 5, Review: This product is exactly as advertised. You won’t be disappointed
Rating: 5, Review: Very useful tool. I use this to get lawn weeds with long tap roots. Much faster than digging. Not useful for weeds with spreading roots (like clover) but I knew that.
Rating: 5, Review: This is a new favorite in yard maintenance tools. Easy to use, well-made, gets the whole weed and a good portion of the root up without all the bending, kneeling.
Rating: 5, Review: Got the weeds in my grass out so far without a ton of effort
Rating: 5, Review: I read the reviews and was hoping it worked as good as they say. It does! Easy way to pull out those big weeds like dandelion. Glad I got it.
Rating: 5, Review: I purchased this weed remover as one tool in my battle to take back a neglected lawn overrun with dandelions, and to a lesser extent, crabgrass. It's easy to use and allows you to quickly remove weeds without any strain on your back or knees. I've found that I can remove about 2-3 cubic feet of weeds per hour (based on how quickly I can fill my wheelbarrow). Ideally you'll want to use it within a few days of rainfall when the ground is somewhat soft. I think most of the broken tools are a result of people forcing it into dry hard soil, or into rocks below the surface. If you feel resistance don't force it, just move onto the next weed.
Rating: 5, Review: This made weeding my yard incredibly easy. And, it means you don't have to bend over. You can extract the weed and eject it right into the bucket or wheelbarrow. I never thought I would see the day where I would get excited about weeding my yard.
Rating: 5, Review: Very useful tool for easy removal of weeds without breaking your back. Works great.
Rating: 4, Review: Works pretty good.
Rating: 5, Review: It worked way better than I expected, does the job as advertised. My yard is heavy clay and soft right now. The thistles came out with the roots intact. I assume as the ground get harder this won't happen but it makes spring yard care easier.
Rating: 5, Review: This just works fantastic, it makes pulling dandelions almost fun!
Rating: 5, Review: This item works as it is supposed to. It will easily pluck out dandelions. I do tend to think that they sprout up faster than I can remove them though. A lot of other type of weeds can be removed just as easily. The only thing I have found difficult is grass runners getting started in the mulch beds.
Rating: 4, Review: Works well for most weeds but doesn’t get whole tap root on dandelions

I've used it after cooking and in no time the food smell is gone! Love the all the settings it has and I use it all the time.
Rating: 5, Review: I bought this to put in my basement near my cat’s litter box and I’ve only had it for a few days and it’s completely totally eliminated the smell. Highly recommend.
Rating: 5, Review: The media could not be loaded. Easy to use and seems to really help purify the air! Also isn’t too loud and has a nice white noise effect.
Rating: 5, Review: The media could not be loaded. After a month of using this product i have noticed a huge decrease of dust going through my room. It definitely does a good job in cleaning your air and you can smell the difference. Those with a lot of dust and pollen where you live. Do yourself a favor and buy it. Modes lvl 1-3 with 1 being audible to 3 being loud arent bad. It has a sleep mode thats super quite. I do run mine 24/7 and have noticed a huge clarity with my air.
Rating: 5, Review: Indeed, this remarkable appliance effectively purifies the air in our kitchen, efficiently eliminating any unpleasant odors produced during cooking.  We consistently utilize it whenever we are present in the kitchen.  I highly recommend this product.  A++
Rating: 5, Review: Finally got this and cannot believe I waited so long. It is quiet and I can notice a difference in room odor for sure. I usually have congestion from mold and pet dander and this has significantly improved the quality of my life. It is also light and easy to move from room to room if needed.
Rating: 5, Review: works perfectly !!!
Rating: 5, Review: This is our 2nd purchase from this buyer. Why? We gave our first one to our daughter because we no longer bred snakes/feeders. But after several years, we got back into it (small scale collection). It worked for us the 1st time and that is the reason for the 2nd purchase. It does the job at eliminating the ""mice"" smell. (We only have 2 sets of breeder mice families.) Lowest setting, you cant hear it if the TV is on - small hum; Medium setting - is what you would expect/regular fan sound. On the highest speed though, sounds like an free-standing oscillating fan on high. We keep ours on low. Our room is approx 10 x 20. Highly recommend. Thank-you!
Rating: 4, Review: Overall this is a high-quality air purifier. It does bring in a lot of dust an some pet hair, but was expecting it to bring in massive amounts of dog hair so I didn't have to sweep and dust bust every day. It is great for white noise, but can be annoying when you are trying to listen to something quietly and you have that in the background. Did not notice any difference in eliminating smells.
Rating: 5, Review: Love that I can control it from my phone and that it’s quiet when running. I am very happy with this purchase!
Rating: 4, Review: I had an condo destroyed by the smell of feces, urine, and marijuana. Then I tried a vinegar solution which did nothing. I bought this air cleaner and it worked very short term. HOWEVER I FELT DIFFERENCE IN AIR QUALITY. I had to get the condo (800 sqft) hospital grade vent sanitized. I am currently using this device in my current home and it fantastic

Rating: 4, Review: This works, is quiet, and easy to use with the timer.
Rating: 5, Review: I've had very gritty eyes for months for some reason since a dark and cold December (so it isn't pollen). On the off chance that the problem could be dust and such blown from my attic's air handler, I bought this purifier and started running it in my bedroom. I figured if it didn't work, at least the air in there would be better, anyway. Well, after the first night and ever since, my eyes have been a lot less gritty. Coincidence? Possibly, but I don't think so....

Rating: 5, Review: Love it
Rating: 5, Review: This has made so much difference in my ability to sleep as well as lowering the amount of dust building up on things. I didn't expect it to be as quiet as it is, especially in night mode, you can barely hear it
Rating: 5, Review: I'm a real human, the kind that hates being attacked by every conceivable airborne particulate and/or pathogen, and wants to breathe better at night and not live under a pile of cat hair and dust. In about 10 days time, our 12x15 bedroom went from being the dust-bowl, to very nearly perfect air quality. This is a very well made and well designed unit, simple user interface, and benefits from an easy to clean pre-filter. Assuming it continues to work this well long-term, I couldn't be happier with it.

Rating: 5, Review: Not bad at all for the price.
Rating: 1, Review: The media could not be loaded. I would give it zero star if I could. This nozzle is very tiny, never seen a nozzle this tiny. And it leaks like crazy out of the box. Stay away from this product.
Rating: 2, Review: A little fragile and stream is not sharp.
Rating: 4, Review: I have only used for a couple weeks so I don’t know about the lasting quality. It is smaller than all the nozzles I’ve had. It works well in spite of the size.
Rating: 5, Review: Works great and does its job. I’ve had no problems so far
Rating: 2, Review: It feels cheap and plasticky, it wiggles on the hose causing leaks when not holding carefully.
Rating: 4, Review: Does the job at a good price
Rating: 4, Review: For what I paid I didn't expect heavy duty nozzles so I'm pleased with my purchase. Don't expect more than a season or two and be gentle with them.
Rating: 4, Review: I like these nozzles. The reason for the 4 star rating is because I could not get one of the nozzles to stop leaking where it was hooked to the hose. Ended up having to get a different washer. Then it worked great.
Rating: 5, Review: Purchased as replacement!
Rating: 5, Review: Works good
Rating: 1, Review: The media could not be loaded. Wanted to water my plants but, couldn't use due to a screw was missing or some kind of end piece that gives the hand nozzle the ability to spray.

Rating: 1, Review: Had to replace a good one that had lasted five or six years. Thought this one, with a suggested retail of $14 or $15 but selling for $7.99 would be a decent choice. WRONG. Should have only been a $3.99 special! It came today, already leaks where it screws to hose even with the washer in place. Lightweight, cheap. Probably isn't going to last half the summer, if that. Piece of junk.
Rating: 1, Review: Nozzle won't turn off. Past return window and 2nd time using it, it doesn't work. Automan can you help?
Rating: 5, Review: Good value on this product. It has an excellent water flow and adjusts easily. We have been using it for a month or so, and there is no issues with it.
Rating: 5, Review: Worked great and was exactly what I was looking for
Rating: 1, Review: The media could not be loaded. Must be made of a cheap plastic since the nozzle couldn’t handle normal water pressure and would leak water
Rating: 3, Review: The pressure jet stream pattern is more of a splattering single stream pattern without much force. The other six patterns work well enough. But in all patterns, it dribbles water from the front of the selector.
Rating: 3, Review: Bought to replace my broken one. They are plastic, work fine for the price. Nothing exciting. Does leak a little bit but can add tape to fix. I'm satisfied with purchase and use it to watery plants and trees in the back yard. Not sure how long will last but cheap price I'm not to worried. Probably try an upgrade next time.
Rating: 3, Review: Worked really well, but started leaking within a few weeks; moved on quickly to a different product.

Rating: 5, Review: I liked this but it didn't charge. I bought it during winter time so didn't use it until summer and learned that I was only able to use it once because I couldn't charge it. Luckily they gave me a refund even after 7 months so im leaving a good review. 😁

Rating: 1, Review: What a waste of money this heavy, load, piece of junk that had no cooling affect at all. It was worse having this around my neck that nothing at all because wearing this just made the heat worse.
Rating: 4, Review: I've gotta start this review off by saying this device holds a really great charge it lasts for hours I've never had this run dead on me yet longest I've ran this is 5 hrs. And it didn't die on me its just a fan so don't expect t cool air from this so if u r n pure heat it's just going to blow air but it does help a whole lot and if u r n a muggy room it does feel great or just cleaning n house great I take with me on my walks and when I clean house or workout I really like this I just wish I could find one that actually is a cooler lol but I'm happy with my purchase
Rating: 5, Review: Ladies, I'm dying with these hot flashes. I've been using this fan in the mornings as I get ready. Has 3 speeds and has been a big help!
Rating: 4, Review: I needed this fan! It blows up into my neck and hairline and when my head is cool, it seems the rest of me follows suit. When I took it off the other day, I actually had to put on a blanket. I hope it helps me keep cool all summer. It is a tiny bit noisier than I'd like and does not have a slim design but when I use it at home neither of those things really matter!
Rating: 5, Review: This worked perfect for our trip to Disney world! It helped cool me down and easy to use. Battery life was good and it lasted me a whole. Seems like it’s well made and perfect size to take along.
Rating: 4, Review: You can have one or the other. Power or quiet. You can't have both. I bought the Hotsales one and it was too noisy, even on level 1. Even on level 1 you'd need earplugs. So I bought the Jisulife and it's much quieter but I have to go to level 3 (max power) to give me the power of level 1 on the Hotsales.  So, figure out what's more important to you. Quiet or performance. If you're going to use this doing lawn work in the hot sun, get earplugs and the Hotsales one. If you're going to be using this at picnics where you want to hear people and want a gentle breeze, then get the Jisulife.
Rating: 5, Review: This portable neck fan is comfortable on the neck and when you leave the fan on your neck and your doing something you can easily forget it's there. It's convenient that I don't even need to hold it, I can just leave it on my neck and do things as normal.
Rating: 5, Review: I wear these every day at work, keeps you cool and comfortable if you have frequent hot flashes.
Rating: 2, Review: Maybe if you use it in a air co ditioned place like a gym it might help but the fan is not very good.

Within 48 hours mine were full of fruit flies - which is the reason why I got them. They work as they should! Would buy again.
Rating: 5, Review: The traps are great, reusable, and easy to clean. The bait fluid is ok...BUT...use dark apple cider vinegar with a drop or two of liquid hand soap and these traps really take off and catch a ton of the lil flying beasties. The soap in the vinegar keeps them from escaping. All non-toxic and easy to change out when it fades and stops attracting as many. :-)

Rating: 1, Review: Complete and total bust. Two weeks in and (I'm not exaggerating when I say this) not one single gnat, fly, fruit fly, or insect of any kind has ended up in one of these traps. Followed the directions to the letter and nothing. They fly right past it as tho it's not even there.

Rating: 2, Review: I have an indoor greenhouse. It creates a lot of fruit flies. I have put out 2 traps nearby and it has caught 2 fruit flies in a month. Not worth my purchase
Rating: 2, Review: We had a sudden fruit fly infestation. I’m familiar with TERRO ant traps so I had no hesitation ordering. The amount of solution is insufficient. I chose to empty the traps out every few days, but only had enough solution for 2 uses. Almost $13 for a solution you can make for less than 25 cents. I reused the apple containers but any small plastic container will do. Took about 2-3 weeks to eradicate them. Watch YouTube for instructions, save yourself a lot of money. Apple cider vinegar, 1 drop dish detergent & your set. I also used baking soda & plain vinegar in each drain at night, allow it to foam up, close the drains, fill sink with about an inch of water. Another tip is if you have a garbage disposal try to keep that drain closed as much as possible when not in use. PS - I also tried Green Gobbler it did absolutely nothing.
Rating: 1, Review: I've had 3 traps out for 3 days and so far not one fly in any of those traps while flys still flying. I will leave out for another 4 days to give one week try but so far I'm not impressed.

Rating: 5, Review: I saw some of the reviews and am not surprised that these don’t work 100% effective just by themselves. They need to have some sort of bug zapper light next to them so that flies hovering round will get zapped.  For sure there are a lot of flies that got killed by the trap itself, but pairing this with a bug zapper is a beautiful combo and got us completely fruit-fly free in 48 hours.  In addition we poured Green Goblin down the drain in every drain in the kitchen and in the bathroom.  This is what is needed to get the most out of these traps.

Rating: 4, Review: I like that it works very well catching bugs. I don’t like the sour smell. If you have pets place the container where they can’t knock it over because then dead bugs and stinky liquid spills out.

Rating: 4, Review: Recommended.  Just do yourself a favor, and use it as instructed by the manufacturer of your machine. By which I mean, go through the steps they suggest. Simple. And you know what? This product suggests you do the same thing. So, duh. Otherwise, if you follow this product's instructions on a machine that is designed to do another descaling process, you will spend a lot more time just to get the same result. Kinda' a bummer.  The other thing? Yes, you can use vinegar instead in most--most--cases. This product contains Citric Acid and Sulfamic Acid. They should state that on the label. They don't. So I am deducting a star. Don't make people hunt for your ingredients. And it is my fault for not noticing that before I purchase it.  So, please do compare the various options before you purchase. I likely won't purchase again because I will use vinegar instead (using the the machine's/product's own instructions). But this solution does work as it should when used as you are instructed to use it . . . in the machine you purchased.
Rating: 5, Review: Easy to use and less costly than the manufacturer's product.
Rating: 5, Review: I bought the product to descale my coffee maker. It was easy to use and cleaned well.
Rating: 5, Review: Works great!
Rating: 5, Review: So easy to use and cleaned my Nespresso machine perfectly the first time.
Rating: 3, Review: After Bed, Bath, and Beyond closed, I didn't know where to get Descaler. Someone suggested Amazon, so I ordered it from you. It took over an hour from start to finish to descale. My coffee this morning was fine, so I assume it worked.
Rating: 1, Review: Waste of time and money. My coffee machine is still clogged.
Rating: 5, Review: This always cleans my Nespresso Creatiste One perfectly. I believe it has extended the life of the machine. Never had an issue.
Rating: 3, Review: Disclaimer: I might have just been an idiot, but I don’t think this worked on my Nespresso.  I used it multiple times and after each time, Nespresso still thinks it needs descaling. It’s a confusing process.

Rating: 5, Review: never buyuing original again, this works as well!
Rating: 5, Review: I used this descaling product for my Keurig coffee maker. I followed the directions from the Keurig site and used this product instead of a Keurig branded product. This was easy to do. I have used this product for a couple of years and have not had any issues using it and my coffee maker still works perfectly :)
Rating: 5, Review: Does just what it says
Rating: 3, Review: Have a Keurig Supreme coffee maker. Light was on to descale. Followed the directions. Cleared twice with clear water. Made a cup of coffee afterwards. All good. Next day coffee maker didn’t work. Tried all the remedies and no luck. Cannot say it was the descaling solution but now I must buy a new coffee maker.
Rating: 4, Review: Reasonably priced and does its job. All I can ask for.
Rating: 2, Review: I used the product according to the package instructions and my Keurig still calls for descaling. I subsequently have repeated the process multiple times, using Keurig instructions and variations of both the product directions, Keurig instructions and tips gleaned from online product discussions. Bottom line: I think descaling this type of coffee maker (as long as you're not using water with heavy mineral content) is a waste of time and money. The descale warning of the unit is likely triggered by volume of water run through it, not actual scale buildup - an idiot light.
Rating: 5, Review: The descaler solution arrived, I used it in my Keurig coffee maker and it worked.
Rating: 1, Review: Followed directions to the letter. Kuerig won’t even start. Very unhappy.
Rating: 5, Review: Wow. Worked the first time around

This constantly repeats. It’s pretty annoying to hear and distracting when I’m trying to sleep.
Rating: 5, Review: I’ve had this fan for over a year and continuously receive compliments. Not only is it sleek and aesthetically pleasing, but it works wonders. Cool air feels like you’re sitting outside with a cool breeze. 10/10
Rating: 2, Review: Used it for about two hours when then motor developed a high pitched ""whine"". Not sure what is making the noise, but it's NOT quiet.
Rating: 5, Review: Was looking for a tower fan for my dorm room and happened upon this beauty of a fan when it was on sale. I've had it for a full school year now, and its been amazing! Our dorms don't have a/c, but this guy has been working very well to keep my room cool and the oscillating setting helps give some circulation. The sleep mode setting is nice and quiet too. I'm a sucker for products with appealing designs, and this one is so sleek and pretty that it doesn't feel like an awkward eye sore in my dorm. Overall, very happy with it!
Rating: 5, Review: We decided to finally upgrade from old box fans to bladeless, tower fans and we struck gold with this product, I'm so glad we didn't have to look for another fan, this one is perfect, feels wonderful, super quiet, easy to use and is just an all around A+++. We liked it so much that we bought another one and may even by a 3rd, for our teen's room.
Rating: 1, Review: Item came broken
Rating: 5, Review: Easy assembly but more importantly it pushes cold air out like it's trying to add a 3rd layer of ice to my heart and unless you're actively paying attention to it you won't hear it running like a typical fan.
Rating: 5, Review: This is visually pleasing and doesn't take up very much room in my living room. It has a number of variations as to how the air is delivered as well as a sleep cycle. However, therein lies the one thing I don't like about it: too many options. Between the control panel and LED display, there are 12 different buttons. Some seem to overlap between the fan and remote while others don't. Also, the icons on the buttons aren't exactly self-explanatory: for instance, what does a leaf mean? Apparently, ""natural mode."" What exactly does that mean? Are all the other modes unnatural?  Even with my objection to the options, I'm still giving it five stars because it has good customer service. I had my questions answered within a day of sending them in.
Rating: 5, Review: This tower fan is very impressive from the the power in distance from even cleaning this fan even helps with the A/C efficiently . Awesome fan
Rating: 5, Review: Bought this fan to replace a quietset quiet comfort tower fan. That fan wasn't bad, but its highest setting was barely a breeze. This fan packs a punch for it's size. I need a fan to sleep and this one works perfectly. Really helps to cool down my room. Really happy with this fan.
Rating: 5, Review: This fan is amazing! Super quiet and you can feel the air from across the room! Truly the best!
Rating: 1, Review: This piece of crap is no better than a regular floor fan that you could buy anywhere. Not sure why it gets good reviews!!! It’s a huge disappointment!!
Rating: 5, Review: It's quiet. It blows cool air. It's oscillation is great. I love it and am very satisfied with it.
Rating: 5, Review: El hecho de que no haga ruido cuando está funcionando es un gran plus.
Rating: 5, Review: Love this fan! Very quiet and cools the room very well!
Rating: 5, Review: Love this fan. Kept me comfortable until I put my window a/c in and now I use it to pull the cool air to other rooms. Couldn’t be happier with the quality of this fan.
Rating: 5, Review: I bought the fan to keep my dogs cool while my sister and I are at work since we live in PA and don’t have central air. I will say if your bed is tall get a box or something to sit the fan on so it can blow right at you. On level 4 aimed right at my bed not only does it keep me and all 4 of our dogs nice and cool, but we even have to use a blanket! I’ll be buying 2 more for our other bedrooms!!! 10/10 super easy to put together, no tools required.
Rating: 4, Review: It's a good fan. Little more expensive than the others I checked out. I chose this one because it sells so well, not often returned, and hopefully lasts a long time, good reviews. Just as noisy as any other tower fans but still fairly quiet. I like the remote and you can turn off the annoying beep. Overall satisfied as long as it lasts for a good value.
Rating: 4, Review: We try not to turn on the house air conditioner until June first if possible. There are two ceiling fans but they make this knocking sound if left on high or medium settings and on low sometimes a low ticking/ squeaking sound. This fan has great reviews. Very easy to put together without looking at directions and it was smooth as a breeze. It's not silent on high, but you can easily drown out when on the phone, watching TV, listening to music, or talking. This the first night so let's see how it goes.
Rating: 3, Review: Great Fan! Cool and Quiet but will be returning because of the height. We have a taller bed and because of the fans height, it just blows on the mattress and box spring. I will be looking for something taller.
Rating: 2, Review: This fan is high powered and sleek but no matter what setting you put it on, it will go into some power saving mode and turn down to setting 1 in the middle of the night. Multiple times throughout the night I keep having to turn it back up and it sucks. I do not suggest for the money
Rating: 5, Review: This fan is amazing! Quiet, sleek and very effective ! I bought 2 and I’m thinking of purchasing another 2! Best Buy ever if you have bedrooms on 2nd floor and gets warm up there.
Rating: 5, Review: Love how cool the air is! And all of the settings make it convenient for any setting!
Rating: 5, Review: This is the quietest fan I have ever owned! It’s also powerful and in night mode it is completely dark!
Rating: 1, Review: Have no idea why this got so many great reviews. Yes quiet, but I am not after that I am after a powerful fan that keeps me cool. It is really weak and going to get a regular fan vs this. sending back for full refund.
Rating: 1, Review: There’s no “cool” air. Noise level is pretty high. I thought I’d be able to connect it to my phone, but sadly no. You can get a fan that functions just as good for a lot less.
Rating: 4, Review: It's good. sometimes there's a pitch whistling that bothers me when I'm trying to sleep.
Rating: 3, Review: I decided to buy this in a different color since i had already bought a black one that I keep in my bedroom. I was thinking this one would be the same height as the Black one but it isn't . Its smaller and has four speeds to it instead of six like the black one has. I was thinking and hoping this would be equal to the black one that I already owned. Anyway it's gets the job done for now and I can get away with having it because i have central air in case it gets humid in the upcoming months.
Rating: 1, Review: I actually had to buy another unit for a very small room. It doesn’t use much power but the reviews I read and the listed description does not measure up to the ability of the unit. It took two purchases to semi-cool one bedroom. Would not buy.
Rating: 5, Review: This is probably the best electric fan I've seen. It's quiet, elegant and made with quality materials. I would buy it again.

Rating: 5, Review: Great quality pillow case! A perfect color match to my blanket! It fits a standard size pillow and has a zipper closure, which is great as well. The feel of the pillow case is very high end compared to the gray cases I have. Would definitely recommend!
Rating: 5, Review: They are soft & silky. They are well made. They stay closed.
Rating: 5, Review: We love these! We were looking for the most economical ones to try until we decide on our new bedroom colors. We chose a color that looked like dark orange 🫣,but turned out to be a pretty orange rust color 🤗! The other one was a beautiful sea foam green❣️I definitely will be buying from here once I choose our colors! They are not thin and rough like I mostly have found in stores. They are really really nice.
Rating: 1, Review: It is not silk. They are selling polyester as silk. You can take a small piece of the fabric and burn it to see. The fabric burns and becomes hard like when plastic burns. This shows it’s polyester. Silk buttons like fabric and becomes brittle. Very bad company!!
Rating: 1, Review: I bought this to replace a discontinued silk pillowcase whose zipper had broken. I’ve slept on silk pillowcases for the last five years or so, and this is not silk.  It looks pretty and the fabric is smooth, but it sleeps hot, and the moisturizers & skin oils on my face stick to it when I go to bed. It’s really unpleasant. I should have known better thinking I was getting a good deal.  I’m off to search for a real 100% mulberry silk pillowcase.
Rating: 5, Review: Makes it so nice on your hair and face. Would recommend. They are quite thin
Rating: 5, Review: These pillow cases fit our king sized pillows perfectly and the zipper seems solid and will last a while. We washed and used them last night and they sleep so much cooler than cotton. We will be buying several more! HIGHLY RECOMMEND!
Rating: 5, Review: Love these pillow cases. Great feel! Easy to wash. Look great!
Rating: 5, Review: I bought these because these pillowcases really help with my hair when I sleep but I was even more impressed with the quality of packaging these came in. It was like an envelope. Very elegant and classy looking. That sold me for more in the future!! Great quality too!
Rating: 1, Review: I've had these for less than a month and the zipper pull came off of the one pillowcase.
Rating: 4, Review: Received this quickly. Very soft and good quality case with zipper. No loose strings binding up in the zipper like other brands . Doesn’t shrink when washed.
Rating: 5, Review: Love this case, can’t remember the exact color I ordered and now it’s not available. I would order 4 more if the color I got originally were available.
Rating: 4, Review: Good quality product! Incredibly comfortable to sleep on. I had silk pillowcases from a different shop, and these feel more like satin. I wash them on a regular cycle, and it works just fine.
Rating: 2, Review: These pillowcases are great at first. But then they fray and pill. They catch on my engagement ring. Even the one I got for my fiancé is pulling. They’re really smooth, I like that but the fabric being ruined in a matter of 2 weeks is a problem
Rating: 1, Review: I only received one pillow case
Rating: 5, Review: Generously sized, smooth, but my wrinkles are due to my age and CPAP. Love this case because it stsys cool, but I have to hide it from the cat, she wants to knead it which snags it!
Rating: 4, Review: Hasn't stopped any wrinkles for me, but it is made well.
Rating: 5, Review: Love this pillowcase. I’ve tried a couple of different brands in the past and the zipper has always broken after a short period of time. So far so good for this one!
Rating: 5, Review: Better silk, good sewing, hidden zipper
Rating: 5, Review: I used to wake up with the whole side of my face bearing the impression of every crease in my pillow. I got a silk pillowcase and problem solved. The dont make you hot or sweaty. Launder beautifully. It says not to dry them, but i did accidentally and it was fine. However it will probably last longer if you didn't. I love this so got two. Mulberry silk, is the best. Hair isnt all tangled and frizzy either.
Rating: 1, Review: Did a burn test. It's not silk.
Rating: 5, Review: These pillowcases are soft and a lot cooler than synthetic satin. My wavy hair is much happier. These are well worth the price. Note that you do need to hand wash these. That said, it's easy and they have so far held up great.

Rating: 1, Review: The initial charge time is long but expected. I got the two pack and both of the levels of liquid in the cartridges differed vastly. No evidence of spillage… maybe a resold return? Either way, I’m hoping they make this right.
Rating: 2, Review: I was really excited to get this, however when I opened it the little fuel thing is half filled, the refills for this are expensive. Hate to think I'm paying so much for a half filled refill.
Rating: 4, Review: I waited 3 years before writing this review, and in a nutshell, its been great. The only knock is the battery life. Could last a little longer. I’m surrounded by a pin oak laden, swampy woods, that is wet all year and full of skeeters. I can sit outside without being pestered. I’m happy with it.
Rating: 1, Review: Ordered this last week and received it very fast. Tried it out today and did nothing to detract the flies and bugs in our patio. We love the idea of how it would work, but it’s ineffective so back to the citronella candles
Rating: 1, Review: Terrible charging life of maybe a maximum of 12 hours.
Rating: 5, Review: The bugs do not show up when this thing is turned on. Works great and does its job
Rating: 3, Review: I purchased two, however, one won't hold a charge. $50 item that Amazon won't exchange.
Rating: 1, Review: Thermacell Patio Shield worked one time and then was never able to warm up enough to vaporize the liquid. I'll try getting it replaced but I have no faith in the product.
Rating: 5, Review: Small
Rating: 1, Review: I live in Phoenix, and was hoping this would let me sit in my backyard in the evenings. I am a mosquito magnet, sprays or citronella don’t make too much of a difference, and I was hoping to really love this based on the reviews. Unfortunately, it did nothing for me. I had them landing all over my ankles, legs and arms still. I am going to give it a second shot, but I let it warm up for 15 mins, and then sat outside with it for about 45 mins. It wasn’t great, and as of now I am not a fan. The mosquitos are insane in Phoenix though.
Rating: 1, Review: I followed instructions perfectly…. fully charged and after charging i can see light smoke coming out the top. I set it outside on my porch as a test. 100 or so mosquitos covering the screen just 5 feet away from the device. Even after 30 minutes not a single mosquito has moved on. They don’t seem phased at all. Epic fail.
Rating: 2, Review: It doesn't do much at the camp ground sadly .
Rating: 5, Review: I recently took the Thermacell mosquito repellent device on a camping trip deep into the Everglades, known for its dense mosquito populations. Waking up surrounded by clouds of giant mosquitoes was no picnic, but within just 10 minutes of turning on the Thermacell, the area around me was completely free of mosquitoes. It was astonishing! I highly recommend this product to anyone who is looking for a reliable solution to keep the mosquitoes at bay. It truly works wonders!
Rating: 1, Review: Well, I gave it a try but it just doesn’t work! I’m in west Florida and continue to get eaten alive by mosquitoes :( I tried it multiple times, let it “warm up” prior to using the area but it’s just not working. Would have given it zero stars but that’s not ann option.
Rating: 1, Review: Didn’t find this to work at all, and it’s expensive to run
Rating: 5, Review: My husband is a mosquito 🦟 magnet. They seriously attack his face and any exposed skin. We tried this while sitting in our backyard around our propane fire table. I put the device between my son and husband. We sat out for about 30 minutes and neither of them had a single bite. We live in Florida so that’s pretty remarkable. I was sitting on the opposite side. About 2ft away from the device and I got 1 bite in my ankle! I consider that a huge win!
Rating: 4, Review: It seems to be helping with a nasty mosquito problem. I would definitely purchase it again. It takes awhile to warm up so unless you are going to be in an area for a substantial period of time it isn’t worth deploying. Refills aren’t cheap.
Rating: 3, Review: It isn’t navy blue. Much brighter. It has to be plugged in to charge unlike previous models I own. The location for the charging is very low, and the plug doesn’t stay in. One good rain and it could be ruined. So it has to be taken inside when not in use. I really think I’m going back to the previous fuel cell version. Not sure it was worth $$$
Rating: 5, Review: Good deal
Rating: 1, Review: I purchased this for my wife after we used the other style Thermocell that uses the butane cartridges. Unfortunately when I opened it the repellant cartridge was completely empty and the liquid contents were all over the inside of the box and the parts inside.
Rating: 1, Review: I sent back this product. It is very cheaply made. One of the two did not work. For the money, I expected a much better product.
Rating: 5, Review: I use it on our covered deck...I go out there and there are mosquito's and bugs buzzing around.....a short time later-they ARE GONE. LOVE IT!
Rating: 1, Review: So far this product does nothing to keep insects away. Matter of fact, the light feature in the product attracts flies and other insect instead of putting up this magical dome to keep them away.  I'm very disappointed in the results so far and would like to return this product and get my money back.
Rating: 5, Review: These work, located in northern CA. Save my back yard
Rating: 2, Review: Not very effective at all. The refills are about $13.
Rating: 1, Review: Does not work. If you live in the southeast and have a noseeum problem, this does not work.
Rating: 1, Review: This product did not work for us at all. I could see little puffs of the chemicals coming out of it so I presume I was using it correctly. But the mosquitoes were not repelled by it at all... we saw several of them within just a few inches of the unit buzzing around like it wasn't there. I don't understand why others seem to have gotten a much better outcome than we did, but we quit using it after a few tries.
Rating: 1, Review: Does not work Does not stay on within 30 minutes it shuts off even fully charged

Rating: 5, Review: I have always had good luck with giving my plants miracle grow.
Rating: 5, Review: I bought this product because I had a plant that I had not taken very good care of. It stayed by the window, and I watered it weekly, but I never paid it much attention beyond that. One day I decided to step things up, and prune the dead leaves so that I could start taking better care of it. Much to my disappointment, when I inspected it closely it was limp, and didn't look healthy at all. I bought the plant food to give it as good of a chance as possible to be healthy again. Much to my surprise within a couple of hours of adding the plant food the leaves perked up, and looked much better. It is great to see a product work the way it's supposed to, but this one exceeded my expectations!
Rating: 5, Review: This multipurpose plant food is great for any plant, especially vegetables! Makes them grow faster and healthier. Definitely a necessity when planting.
Rating: 5, Review: Happy with the product.

Comfy and thick!
Rating: 2, Review: This mattress pad has no loft. It did not make my bed feel any softer. I gave it two stars because the quality seems pretty good.
Rating: 2, Review: We’ve had this for not even a month & really, it already needs to be replaced; it just doesn’t stay puffed up, like it needed more filling to begin with. We followed instructions on getting it ready to be used, and it WAS comfortable for the first week or so. Since then, it’s just continued to flatten out & feels like there’s nothing extra on the bed anymore.
Rating: 5, Review: Fits great and feels so good.
Rating: 5, Review: Improved the softness of my bed, a bit pricey but still good
Rating: 5, Review: I love it
Rating: 5, Review: I just found out I needed a mattress pad. When I say this thing is comfortable and made me sleep like a newborn and it did its job well. In my opinion, this is quite better than getting a new mattress, plus I had a huge coffee stain on my mattress, so I also got it because it was a little embarrassing to see.
Rating: 5, Review: This mattress pad is very soft and fluffy. I purchased a king size and it fits my bed great!
Rating: 5, Review: Very good addition. Makes the bed more comfortable.

Rating: 5, Review: I didn’t have any trouble with the hand pump. It worked great. I sprayed a perimeter outside my house and fence. I went outside today and for the first time ever there were not cobwebs on my fence and outdoor furniture which I constantly cleaned up every single day. Doing this daily was endlessly annoying and tiring. Not to mention the ants outside are all gone even though I put out ant bait so many times and they were coming in the house lately. I tried some peppermint natural spray before this for the spiders too but it did literally nothing. I’m really happy this is working so well.

Rating: 3, Review: These hand towels feel soft and fluffy, the color is beautiful, but they are not absorbent at all. It states it is cotton????
Rating: 5, Review: Not super thick, but thick enough where they will dry in between and the humid south!
Rating: 5, Review: Use these for bathmats. They're soft and squishy, not like the hotel towel bathmats. These have a bit more cushioning in them. I rotate them, while one is being washed the other is used.  As for super absorbent...one day our clothes washer broke and overflowed and filled the laundry room floor with water. We quickly grabbed towels to soak it up, but they just didn't cut it. Desperate I grabbed everything absorbent, including these mats off the floor. Man, they should have been the first thing I grabbed cause they soaked the puddles right up. Wrung them out and repeated and was able to get everything up.  Ended up buying another set for our other bathroom and another set for a friend. Best things ever.
Rating: 1, Review: Hi! I don’t typically write reviews but am concerned about these towels- they look good and are sturdy but after several washes are leaving lint from the towel on our bodies- I will try another few washes but pretty disappointed.

Rating: 4, Review: Like
Rating: 4, Review: These bath mats are a nice quality for a decent price. They aren’t terribly thick but they are densely woven so they easily absorb water and don’t get caught underneath the door as it opens. Overall I’m satisfied and will likely buy these again.

Rating: 5, Review: Quality and price 👍
Rating: 5, Review: Nice hand towel. Very soft, thick. Hope they last for a while.
Rating: 5, Review: These are great towels. I'm always afraid of buying towels sight unseen because of past issues with towels that shed fibers on me once I'm wet, but these don't do that. They're just very soft, plain old terry cloth towels that are thick enough to feel like quality and that hold up in the wash. If you're looking for basic towels, these are the ones to get.
Rating: 1, Review: What I wanted was this goldish color represented here. What I received was a light beige. It was nothing like the picture. I also didn't like the condition of the towels. They looked like old towels that had been washed over and over. I could understand if the color was a ""bit"" off...but I simply can't understand how they could be so very different. I would advise to stay away from this brand. I will!

Rating: 5, Review: I'm so glad I took a chance ordering these bath mats. Easy to wash with bath towels. After I received the first set I ordered another because I was so pleased with the quality and price.

Rating: 5, Review: Loved the (white&sage)color! Just like I saw on the pictures! Pricing is terrific!
Rating: 4, Review: I like the premium bath rugs better, but they are different too clean. These are basic looking, but they dry fast and easy to clean because they are basically floor towels.

Rating: 4, Review: Best suction ever. Too much for my medium pile carpet. Nice to be able to adjust airflow. Would be perfect if it had an adjustable roller height.
Rating: 3, Review: It is sometimes hard to move over a carpet as the suction is too strong. It needs a feature to adjust for carpet height. Can't recommend.
Rating: 4, Review: I previously had a Dyson for 15 years and it finally met the end of its life. Bought this because I didn’t want to spend $600 on a new vacuum right now. It’s fine for a $160 vacuum, but you can’t compare it to a Dyson in my opinion. Works fine, but not super user friendly. Has several red levers that release different parts. I can’t ever remember how to empty the bin and start pushing on the red levers which only loosens other parts. I like that you can just rinse the filter and reuse. The hoses come out of the handle so it’s a little clunky to push back and forth. Like I said, fine for a $160 vacuum but doesn’t compare to higher end brands.
Rating: 4, Review: This vacuum sucks up everything; I was quite surprised at it pulled out of my carpets, that I thought were clean. It is a little small for a whole house and the dirt catcher has to be emptied regularly.
Rating: 5, Review: I have. Rainbow Vac that I use for deep cleaning, I got this for everyday use and so far it’s been a great little Vacuum, it’s easy to get around , and easy to empty the canister. The lift away is great to get in small spaces and for edging.. The Suction is strong and bare floor and carpet options are perfect. Highly recommend ..
Rating: 5, Review: LOVE this vacuum. My previous vacuum was a shark, I loved it! It lasted me for over 10 years before it finally gave out. This one is even better! The canister is huge! I had to empty my old one twice in one cleaning session. This one I have to empty every few cleaning sessions. No clog issues and the suction is insane!
Rating: 5, Review: I've had this vacuum for 3 years now and as long as you care for it and clean out regularly it does an amazing job! Ruined all others for me. Just buy it!
Rating: 5, Review: I bought this shark for my daughter and she says it works great. I also have an older shark and love it.
Rating: 4, Review: Without exception, this is the strongest vacuum I have ever owned and I highly recommend. I only have one area rug and it looked brand new after the first pass. And it is strong enough to pick up dust bunnies not directly under the nozzle.  The only concern I have is that it is very heavy (I believe about 14 pounds) which makes it a little less easy to use for this senior citizen. It is a great vacuum, however.
Rating: 5, Review: It had a little oil on the box, but was brand new so it was a great deal
Rating: 1, Review: Worked perfectly for about 6 months. Started to overheat and smoke. No clogs, just a faulty machine. Would not recommend.
Rating: 4, Review: It works well, picks up anything in its path. As someone with fibromyalgia and arthritis, it is nearly unusable due to how difficult it is to push, and it’s very heavy. I literally dread having to vacuum with this beast. I wanted to send it back and get another oreck, but the box was destroyed. But it does what it’s meant to do.
Rating: 3, Review: The media could not be loaded. This vacuum is very loud! It was easy to put together. Seems to have very good suction and is easy to maneuver. Picked up alot of dust/debris. Lift away feature is nice. It's lightweight. There is only one spot to hold the attachments tho so the other one you have to put on top or keep off. They fell off within a few minutes of vacuuming. The cord is not nearly as long as I thought it was and doesn't even reach fully to my back bedrooms of my house. Even when adjusting the section it seemed to have a lot of trouble on my shag rug. The power button and canister are very lower to the ground which causes me to have to bend over to turn on or off or adjust for hard floor to carpet. Overall I think I expected more from this vacuum. I've been using sharks for many years. This one's definitely not my favorite and I think I'll be returning.
Rating: 5, Review: is good to have 2 power settings even though on fluffy hugs dont clean
Rating: 3, Review: Dog hair gets tangled around rollers which makes vacuuming really tedious. It's also quite heavy in that it doesn't maneuver too easily. I bought the Shark Stratos instead - a lot more expensive but it works well!
Rating: 5, Review: Easy to assemble and lightweight. Great power for pet hair pickup. Easy empty bins and cleanable filters make this a great vacuum for a house with a dog and two cats!
Rating: 5, Review: This is my third Shark vacuum cleaner and I got it to replace an older one that had broken hose part that could not be repaired, although the motor worked fine. I really like the suction power of Shark vacuums and the versatility that comes with them. My first Shark vacuum I gave to my mom since I wanted to upgrade to the next model. My second model worked well up until a few weeks ago when the hose attaches to the body of the container broke and I would need to replace the whole body unit to fix it, so I bought a new Shark since it could not be fixed. This new one works well and feels a little bit heavier than my older models. I like the lift away feature so I can use it to clean the carpet on my steps. I have a lot of the accessories and I save them from all three of my Shark vacuums and they fit all of the models. The only negative about the Shark is when I take the hose attachment off to vacuum under my bed, the vacuume sometimes tips over and that is what caused the broken hose part to break on my older one. I like the convienence of washing the filters and not having to buy new ones or have to buy bags.
Rating: 5, Review: After rug was vacuumed with two other machines, used this new one and was surprised how much dirt it picked up. Some people gave it poor review because of weight, I found that lowering the suction helps, and use the wheels to move it. Also, disconnect the beater brush to use the accessories. Based on product description, I expected this model to have lights on the beater brush unit, and a bare floor adapter; it did not.

Rating: 5, Review: This is my favorite vacuum! Works so well, and efficient
Rating: 3, Review: I liked my other shark better, but I needed one quick. This one’s very heavy and I do not like the way that the neck swivels.
Rating: 5, Review: We have two Australian Shepherds so there is a lot of fur flying in our house! This vacuum picks up every little bit. Highly recommended!
Rating: 5, Review: Easy to put together. Light weight and easy to use. Picks up even the tiny dog hairs that othe sweepers left behind. Had just vacuumed the previous day and the dirt and hair it picked up unbelievable. No dusty smell. Great for the price compared to other vacuums we have owned.
Rating: 5, Review: I knew a Shark would be a good product. We have a cannister that works and has for many years. Whomever said this does not pick up anything obviously forgot to turn it on. The suction is very strong on this and will pick up a rug. Regarding the rollers not working, There are 2 speeds on the switch. I had to read the directions (imagine that) to see why I did not get a green light. Answer? Because I did not put it on the other suction setting. Then the light came on and the rollers were spinning. If the power is on normal they only roll as you move it across the carpet because it is sitting on the carpet. I guess the only thing I wish it might have is a little height adjustment for carpet or floor tile. But overall I am happy with this Vacuum.

Rating: 1, Review: The product was used while I bought a new product. The box of product was completely damaged and there was liquid inside the tube. The bottom of the bottle was black like it was burned or something like that.
Rating: 4, Review: The media could not be loaded. Appears to work just fine
Rating: 5, Review: Works exactly like it should. The spray nozzle has not gotten stuck. Hopefully it never will. And the clip tab on the top to expose the pour nozzle is a unique and convenient idea. Olive oil doesn’t come out too fast when you have to drizzle over your food, in a pan, or on a baking sheet.
Rating: 5, Review: Im not sure why there are complaints, its spraying very well. Im using it for my airfryer foods and I love it.
Rating: 5, Review: These things work great versus the cylinder pump sprayer of which I had 2 of them start to just sputter the oil. I guess the price is okay as you get 2 of them and they work.
Rating: 1, Review: I was really excited about this product, but the 1st time using it, it sprayed the olive oil at a 90 degree angle and in a straight stream not spread out like in the picture, which makes it difficult to actually hit the thing you are trying to spray.
Rating: 2, Review: I love the premise of this product and it all operates smoothly between the pour and spraying options, however, the seal between the lid and jar doesn't seem to stop oil from leaking out from under the top at every use. I'm not sure if I received a defective unit, but I'm bummed about this product. It is unfortunately always covered in olive oil and greasy and needs to sit on a paper towel to absorb what leaks. I'd love to try another unit from this seller to see if the problem can be remedied. Otherwise, the quality of the parts is great!
Rating: 5, Review: Only had this for a few days but so far I love it and it works great.
Rating: 2, Review: I ordered the two pack sprayer. White and green. The white is not white. It looks very old and dirty. And when I pulled it out of the package and pressed down on the lever, liquid sprayed out of it. I was under the assumption, I was going to receive a brand new product. When in fact, this seems used, Old and was returned and then sold to me.
Rating: 2, Review: Order the white one and a beige/khaki colored arrived. And after first use had some leaking on the underside of the misting lever when pumping it. Will monitor and may change review if it was a fluke. Otherwise will be returning

Rating: 5, Review: This spray bottles are great . Spray with one hand and pour if needed one handed
Rating: 4, Review: I saw this on tik tok and I had to get it. My 10year old is learning to cook so I got it so it would be an easy to handle bottle that can help her spray and pour. It is helping her feel independent and proud to cook.  Very easy to use and refill.  I am going to get at least 2 more bottles. I have veg oil in one now and will get 2 more foe olive oil and extra virgin olive oil. One of my fav kitchen purchases all year.
Rating: 1, Review: Worked for a week. By week two the nozzle gets clogged and starts to spray in ever direction except the one you want. The nozzle opening is so small it’s hard to clean. I will throw away.
Rating: 3, Review: I have screwed the lid on as tight as I can but it still leaks whether we use the sprayer or the spout. We Love that it replaces the aerosol spray (Pam) but just wish it works better.
Rating: 5, Review: Wanted to be able to spray oil as well as pour into pan, these fit the bill perfectly. And being glass is a big plus.
Rating: 1, Review: Arrived broken. Sprayer would not work.
Rating: 4, Review: I like that this is a glass bottle. I thought it would spray more but it’s more of a little spritz of oil.
Rating: 5, Review: It took a few weeks for them to arrive but when they did they were in great condition and well packed. I have had these for a couple weeks now and couldn't be happier. Great spray feature as well as clean poring without leaking down the sides. I am very happy with my purchase.
Rating: 4, Review: I was skeptical seeing these all over TikTok, but they work much better than I anticipated. The sprayer really gives a good misting of oil, so it's a great replacement for PAM or other nonstick sprays with propellants and other junk in them. I used olive oil and vegetable (sunflower) oils and they both worked well.  The plastic handle feels cheap and a bit flimsy, so I would recommend handling it carefully. No breakage so far though.
Rating: 5, Review: Better then then Pam
Rating: 5, Review: I love that it sprays and has a pouring option. So much easier to use than to keep getting the big bottle of oil out. The only thing I don't like is the spray comes out in a straight line instead of a rounded mist (like most cleaners would). It still works really well & I like it, I just think it spraying out in a straight line was odd!

Rating: 4, Review: Such a great product. I bought one for our downstairs bathroom and it lasted over 6 months. Got the refill and although it does not smell quite as strong as the original, it's still a lovely scent.
Rating: 1, Review: Does not work
Rating: 1, Review: While it is very pretty and is easy to fit into small spaces, I don’t smell it at all. Even when I flip the reeds as instructed - no smell. The quality of the oil is just not there. Plus, the ease of use is poor as whenever I flip the reeds I get oil all over my hands and THEN I can smell it, and can’t get rid of the smell from my fingers. Poor performance all the way around.
Rating: 4, Review: It is pretty, it smells nice. Scent was strong first 3 days and now it does not throw the scent as much. It works for smaller spaces

Rating: 4, Review: Overall, it is a good product.
Rating: 1, Review: I have a very strong nose and can hardly smell the vanilla cashmere! Should have stuck with the first one I bought which was the sandalwood.
Rating: 2, Review: It’s a very cute product from a design perspective, but I do not think it is for home use. Maybe for a bathroom with way more traffic. I bought it based on a Buzzfeed rec, and within a day, my neighbor called my landlord while I was at work, worried that there was burning plastic in my apartment. She was right—it kind of smells like a diaper that has been burning in a vat of Axe body spray, with an inexplicable undertone of backed up sewage. Weeks later and it isn’t any better. I had to pour the liquid down the drain. Huge waste of money—I think maybe the seller replaced the essential oil that was supposed to be in there with, like, a bargain bin version of Febreeze.
Rating: 5, Review: This puts off just enough scent in my bathroom.
Rating: 5, Review: Just like the title says! If you’re a minimalist that wants a bit of flare, this is it. It’s functional as well since scent comes out of it. The scent doesn’t fill a standard sized bedroom. It does, however, fill a half bath. My bathroom only has the toilet and sink vanity. When you walk in you smell it and I have all reeds in it currently. The less reeds in it, the more subtle the scent. So to fill a small living area you’d need 2-3 of these. I think these are meant for small areas such as small bathrooms since they make such a statement when you look at them, because they’re not small.  I have the coconut lime scent which is a lot when you’re really close but as you get farther away, leave the room for a bit and then come back to it, it gets better. I like summer scents and this one reminds me of summer.  I will be purchasing another one of these for my other bathroom with a different summer scent. I imagine some are stronger than others so I’d keep that in mind. Overall this was a great purchase!
Rating: 5, Review: I put this in my bathroom a few days ago and have been turning the reeds every day. The fragrance is a whiff and not overwhelming.

Rating: 5, Review: These were really nice. We didn't have the plug-in light they go into, but we just taped them to the wall behind a night light (using painter's tape). We put out three of them. All have bugs on them, and one of them is almost full now. Once a bug is stuck, it's stuck. It can't get off.
Rating: 5, Review: Definitely works best at night. I think over all it's worth it. Especially in the kitchen & overnight, this product will tackle flies effortlessly over the weeks. I do highly recommend a salt gun for during the day.😉

A few evenings later, I heard a squeak and the shuffling sound of the trap moving on the kitchen tile. Upon inspection, there was no mouse, but a small blood spot and a tiny patch of fur attached to the glue. It appeared that the curious mouse walked onto the trap and, despite some difficulty, managed to pull itself off.  Despite leaving the traps out for another week (and adjusting their locations), nothing similar happened involving a mouse. After watching a few youtube videos, which highlighted the ineffectiveness of glue traps and the cruelty of the traps (on the few occasions when they do work), I ordered a set of mechanical traps. Using peanut butter for bait, these mechanical traps (of the snapping jaw variety) were not only better at attracting mice, the mechanical traps were considerably more effective (but not foolproof or instantaneously fatal).  I understand why people might want to use glue traps because they are easy to lay out, but based on my limited experience, I'd suggest using something else to deal with rodents.
Rating: 1, Review: The mouse laugh at these. Horrible!
Rating: 5, Review: Smell at first but good value
Rating: 1, Review: I haven't caught a thing. It's been over a week. The basic mouse traps that snap down are the only thing working. Don't waste your money.

Rating: 1, Review: 36 of these traps and didn't catch 1 mouse. A little bit of mouse hair is all we got. Very disappointed!!!
Rating: 5, Review: It works good.
Rating: 5, Review: Second time these have been ordered. Work as advertised. Good value. Great for those pests that are a bit pesky to catch and recycle outdoors. Also, for those flying southern terradactyls known as palmetto bugs!
Rating: 5, Review: Good glue trap!
Rating: 5, Review: These are great traps. I place them all over my basement as I have more sprikets that I should and an occassional spider here and there. I was not very successful turning the traps into boxes, simply would not catch anything. But laying them flat and they worked great. The adhesive is sticky, be warned. When picking one up, I dropped it face down on the concrete basement floor and it was almost impossible to get up. I got the majority, but still could not get all of the glue up. Overall though, highly recommend.
Rating: 1, Review: I had heard great things about these traps but I watched the mouse walk ON TOP of the sticky traps on two separate occasions and it did not catch her. The traditional snap traps work much better.
Rating: 1, Review: There was literally mouse poo on the trap!
Rating: 5, Review: Living in the country there is ample amount of mice to catch. These work great, mouse gets on but they don't get off. Purchased the bulk pack and for the money works great.

The other one will be going to college this Fall and will use them to pack clothing, bedding, shoes, outerwear, etc.
Rating: 5, Review: Easy to use, easy for storage.

Rating: 5, Review: Excellent product at a good price. It fits all the stuff perfectly.
Rating: 5, Review: These work perfectly for moving! They have a plastic sleeve so you can tag your bags. I just ordered 12 more! Definitely made my move easier! Thank you!
Rating: 5, Review: Used to fill with a great deal of clothes to put in the car for shipping. Really handy.
Rating: 5, Review: Bags are roomy.
Rating: 5, Review: I used these to move when I normally use 30 gallon plastic bins. These worked pretty good and zippers were good and good grip and for the price.
Rating: 5, Review: Surprisingly large, I was able to fit our whole households winter clothes into just a few bags. The label slots are a nice addition.
Rating: 5, Review: Love these bags. Plenty of space, sturdy and easy to move.
Rating: 5, Review: These bags have a high quality material with tough zippers. I believe they will last quite awhile. I’m never buying bins with lids that get lost again!
Rating: 5, Review: Used these bags to move to Las Vegas. They lasted the whole trip there with only a few tearing along the zipper. I like them tho
Rating: 5, Review: Those bags were really useful during my move. They are strong💪. I'm glad I got them in addition to boxes. Boxes are good, but flexible bags are more versatile.

Rating: 5, Review: We are in the shipping business and were looking for something sturdy, waterproof and with enough capacity to hold quite a few smaller packages to make hauling them to the post office easier. These bags are great! Roomier then expected, sturdier then expected. I absolutely love them.
Rating: 5, Review: I saw someone recommend these on another site and I am so glad I bought them! I find them so much easier to use than bins or bags to put away our winter ski items to store in the attic. They are sturdy but easy to carry.
Rating: 5, Review: Strong, and they hold a lot.
Rating: 5, Review: I purchased two sets of 6 of these bags for my most recent move and they have been great! They hold a lot and a good variety of items. I used them mostly for clothing, bedding, and towels but used a few for small boxes of items as well. I appreciated the pictures of people using the handles for backpack straps as putting them on my back allowed me to carry other things with my hands. The durability for one move (that included professional movers throwing them on a truck) is great. I filled some of them where it was hard to pull the zipper and the bag held up in those cases as well. I recommend these to anyone who is moving, wants a reusable product that takes up less space than tubs, and an easy to use product. I plan to use these between moves for groceries and holiday stays at my moms which includes bringing foods, gifts, clothes, etc. these will work so much better than the smaller reusable grocery bags! Yey!
Rating: 5, Review: Used for moving kid out of college ! Very sturdy and roomy !
Rating: 1, Review: I opened the package, instantly when I put some cloth inside, one of the sides started to open. I haven’t even lifted the bag.
Rating: 5, Review: I ordered these bags to help pack up my daughter college bedroom. The bags are x-large durable and lightweight even after stuffing them. It made the moving process effortless. They also stacks well. Just for comparison I was able to put 24 pair of size 8 shoes in one bag.
Rating: 5, Review: We ordered these for storage at our future home, but found them immensely practical during the actual move. Just rolled up the bedding in the morning, threw on a label, put the pillows in a second one, moved, unrolled the bedding and were ready for a night of sleep. So handy. Others accommodated boxes of odds 'n ends, food boxes, etc. But the bedding convenience was our favorite. We definitely recommend this product.

Rating: 5, Review: Seems to work.
Rating: 1, Review: I have ordered this before and had no problem with this food then. I ordered another time and a few humming birds came around and left. After that, I did not see one hummingbird. So strange. I wonder if the product changed. It’s disappointing. I’m going back to making my own for the hummingbirds.
Rating: 1, Review: I was so excited to try this product after looking at the reviews. I put small amounts of nectar in my feeder at a time. I washed my feeder every time I refilled it. We have hummingbirds in our backyard and not one would come to the feeder.  Initially, Amazon said no refunds. I was able to contact a customer service representative who was able to understand the product did not work and I had ordered a second one. Fortunately, I did not open the second one. I told him my situation. Because I think I had not opened the second one he said he would give me a refund. I really appreciate customer service of Amazon. I shop here a lot and will continue to do so.  I don’t know why the hummingbirds would not come to the feeder, but they did not and that’s the fact of the matter.  I am now making my own hummingbird nectar from scratch.  Just wanted to give my feedback and let people know this product did not work for me at all! I must have put out five different servings of this nectar and not one time did we ever get a hummingbird.
Rating: 1, Review: The hummingbirds do not like this nectar.
Rating: 1, Review: Maybe I just got a bad bottle because I have ordered from them before without issue, but when I put this latest iteration in my feeder the hummingbirds stopped coming around. I noticed the formula now looks milkier and more opaque as opposed to the almost clear consistency of past bottles. Either way I won't be ordering from them again and I genuinely hope it didn't hurt the birds, as over the past month I have seen fewer and fewer of them in my yard.
Rating: 2, Review: I have bought this three times and the hummingbirds and others love it. My new bottle however, they don't touch. has anyone else notice this?..just curious....

Rating: 3, Review: The fan was great. Purchased it Jan 20th. Used it occasionally during the night. On May 7th I smelled something burning and my fan shut off. No more working fan. Now need to purchase a new one but will not be this one.
Rating: 2, Review: I bought this product last year June. It was great according to its price. It was small, compact, easy to move, moreover good speed. But unfortunately 2 days ago, it suddenly stopped working. After that I smelled of burning which was coming out of the fan. I immediately unplugged the fan. It looked like the motor had burnt.  Amazon should focus on motor replacement for future customers (with payment/free).
Rating: 5, Review: To keep it short and sweet, this fan is great at a great price! Highly recommend for a small space such as a bedroom, bathroom, cubicle/office, or nursery.

Rating: 5, Review: I was using a set of bed sheets that were not cotton, I struggled with them until two days ago I decided they needed to go to a new home. They were not 100% cotton and were slippery, to the point that I could get my feet wrapped in the top sheet and could not move comfortably. I finally concluded that I needed to get a new set of sheets that are cotton 100%. I received the sheets two days ago, washed them and then put them on my bed. What a relief to have cotton sheets again. Yes, I only had one set of sheets for some period of time and now that I have changed to cotton I will be ordering a second set so I can easily change my bed sheets on a more routine basis. The new sheets laundered just fine and I am very pleased with my purchase. Thank you Amazon, from a very happy customer
Rating: 4, Review: Not as soft as I would like but just want something that will hold up good after multiple washings. We shall see.
Rating: 2, Review: I washed these sheets and couldn’t wait to use them. Finally got warm enough this week and put them on my bed. 2 days later I have already found a rip! It’s not by my feet either where perhaps my toe nail cut it- it’s by my head! What the heck!
Rating: 4, Review: These sheets are light, breathable, and comfortable. The pillowcase was a bit too snug for my contour pillow, but it would likely fit a standard size pillow well enough.

Rating: 5, Review: Bought for my Airbnb. Guests love the comfort and style. I love that it is wrinkle free and super easy to wash either with or without some OxyClean to keep it super white. My mom liked it so much that I ordered her one too.
Rating: 1, Review: This cover is cheaply made. It looks nothing like the pictures. I ordered White, and it looks like an oversized sheet. After placing the insert, which is one of the better-made inserts there's no notice of the square imprint. It came with an attached tie and there is nowhere to tie. My insert does not have ties, but if it did wouldn't make any difference bc the tie on the cover is located in the middle. Ties are located in the corners. I won't return bc it's such a hassle being as large as it is, but it does nothing for my bed at all.
Rating: 5, Review: The media could not be loaded. We purchased thee king size cover. This duvet cover comes with two king size pillow shams. It is very soft and comfortable. Fits perfectly over a king duvet and protects it from any stains. I also like that it’s easily removed for washing. We are buying another in a lighter color for use in spring and summer. Some reviews make it sound as if it is a bedspread or comforter and they are disappointed that it’s too thin. It’s important to note this is a duvet cover and not the actual duvet which is purchased separately. I’m not sure where the confusion lies with this.
Rating: 5, Review: This product is amazing. I love how cheap it was but yet still great quality and so soft! I’ve owned lots of duvet covers from target and this one tops them all. This is super soft but still lightweight. Very simple to put on your duvet and i love the zipper closure. I wash this on delicate cycle with cold water and i dried it on delicate about 2-3 times. Highly recommend this product and will be buying more. Also, linen ended up matching my curtains perfectly.

Rating: 2, Review: I have purchased three different sizes of this banket over the last couple of years and they have all been great, exactly what I wanted. I am pretty disappointed in this last purchase. It looks different and is not the. same as the others I purchased. It is just as soft but flimsier and it sheds terribly. I got pilling everywhere, even after I washed and dried it twice. The blanket is soft and comfortable but I'm wondering how much of it will be left after a few washes. Too bad, the blankets I purchased before were perfect, and thus far have proven, not only comfortable but durable and have produced little if any pilling.
Rating: 5, Review: Such a comfy conforter
Rating: 4, Review: Blanket is just as described and as expected to be. I took one star from overall rating, because as I put it on bed, it immediately left a lot of black ""shedding"" on sheet. I read comments for this item and expected some, but not as much of it. I have similar blanket ordered from different merchant that no longer on Amazon and hoping that after two washes it would be done with shedding. If not, I will have to make an update here and remove another star.

I have sensitivities to a lot of different materials, and this blanket is so soft and chemical free that I can barely feel it on my skin, so it does not cause any itching at all. I ordered one in burgundy and a second one in turquoise. I washed it before use, and there was no shedding. The burgundy is more of a brick red, but I like it anyway. The turquoise one is exactly the color I expected. I would definitely recommend it!
Rating: 1, Review: I through the blankets out, I purchased two of them because when you washed them and put them in the dryer, the fabric just kept coming off and coming off and making knotted balls on the blanket throw after about 10 washings I just threw them in the trash
Rating: 1, Review: Soft and plush initially. But one wash and it's Joe Biden's memory... faded and fuzzy
Rating: 5, Review: Great for the money
Rating: 1, Review: The blanket is not useable. With first laundering, giant balls of fuzz develop around the seams and must be pulled off one by one. Don’t buy it!
Rating: 1, Review: The blanket fell apart in the washer disintegrated in the dryer. Quality of the product is horrible.

Rating: 4, Review: It's cute. Hole in hand too small for staff, will not fit through. hole in foot way too big and looks bad. It lights, but no place to secure it. So definitely overpriced. Had to contact seller myself, but they made good on it.

Rating: 5, Review: Very good product, good quality and super perfect price 🤩The lamp works great. It has good lighting. It is also not heavy which is the ideal weight for this product. I like! This is a gift for mom. She loved it!
Rating: 5, Review: Received this little elephant with solar lighted hanging lantern on 02/20/24 as a gift. It arrived in perfect condition, looks cute, and works well, but will turn over in a heavy wind. It hasn't faded yet. We move it to the corner of our garage door or to our front porch during extremely windy days or stormy weather. My son purchased the pink flamingo for someone as a gift. It is a deep and bright color and has not faded either. These decorations make cute gifts.
Rating: 5, Review: I love it. Pay attention to the size though
Rating: 3, Review: Maybe it’s my fault for not paying attention to the size but it’s too small for my taste. I wouldn’t buy it again
Rating: 5, Review: If you are a fan of elephants you need to get one. It really looks great on our deck and the lantern light look so nice at night.
Rating: 2, Review: I wrote a review on this earlier. I was disappointed that it was so light and decided not to give it. It would not hold up to the winds they have where they live.
Rating: 5, Review: My mother law loves elephant so got it as a gift and she loved it.
Rating: 2, Review: Looks awkward during the day. I gave this as a Christmas gift and unfortunately it does not turn on. Must be an issue with the solar panels. Couldn’t return cause it was outside of the return window.
Rating: 1, Review: Light doesn't work. The whole purpose of this was for the light.
Rating: 3, Review: This is the cutest little elephant, but it is very small for the price!! Not much bigger than my hand and light weight for an outdoor statue. We live where it can be very windy and this little guy will more than likely blow away. If I would have realized how small he is I would have passed… especially for $31.
Rating: 1, Review: I thought this would be cute on my lanai and found I had to pull it in with a strong wind because it kept falling over. Well I wasn’t home and it fell over and cracked. There is nothing weighting it down and with the light it becomes too heavy. Unfortunately less than a couple months and I can’t use it anymore. Waste of money.
Rating: 5, Review: Very cute. Great for gift.
Rating: 5, Review: I did purchase this elephant although I ended up returning it. It's super cute and I really struggled with whether to keep it or not but in the end I needed something a little taller for the balcony. If you need something that is on the smaller side, then this cute elephant and solar lantern is the perfect thing to have.

Rating: 1, Review: Came in broken was not able to order another due to late gift exchange.
Rating: 5, Review: I recently chose the Goodeco Elephant Statue as a gift for two very special people in my life – my mother and my girlfriend's mom. This thing turned out to be an absolute hit on both occasions. The statue exudes a charm and elegance that makes it a perfect addition to any garden decor. The solar aspect is great -- no need to fiddle with batteries.  One of the most appealing aspects of this statue is its versatility as a gift. Whether it's for a birthday, a special occasion, or just a thoughtful gesture, it carries a sense of thoughtfulness and uniqueness. The statue's design is sophisticated yet has a certain warmth to it, making it an ideal decor piece that can enhance any outdoor or indoor space.  As a proud supporter of the Alabama Crimson Tide, adding a ""Roll Tide"" note to the gift made it even more special and personal. In summary, the Goodeco Elephant Statue is a fantastic gift choice for anyone who appreciates art, nature, or simply loves unique home decor items. It's a gift that brings joy and beauty, and I couldn't be happier with the decision to buy a couple for some great women in my life.

I’m thrilled with the results. HIGHLY recommend
Rating: 5, Review: Was instantaneous results. Once the light came on anything flying was immediately drawn to it. Only running for less than a hour and needed to clean the catcher bowl. Great probuct especially in south Florida where mosquitoes are immune to every spray thats been created.
Rating: 5, Review: Hooked up to a smart plug so I could control from my phone it comes on an hour b4 I get home and off an hour later I love it definitely keeps the bugs away I love watching the beetles go in they get crispy anyway this thing works exactly as expected

Rating: 5, Review: This is my 3rd zapper. bought 2 last year and they are still working, Having this helps to keeps insects out of my garden.
Rating: 5, Review: I started having an abundant amount of flies for some reason. I didn't want to get the other fly traps since they smell. I got this and set it up last night. This morning when I went outside, there were at least 10 beetles on the ground and the item was covered in Nats and flies. So it works! Very well
Rating: 1, Review: Zapper's power is too weak to kill flies.
Rating: 1, Review: only lasted a few months.
Rating: 1, Review: It really doesn’t work .
Rating: 5, Review: Love this so much
Rating: 5, Review: I now have purchased 8 of these. Fantastic performance and replacement bulbs are also available.
Rating: 5, Review: Kills flys as advertised
Rating: 1, Review: Bought this in November 2023 and already stopped working. Not even a year smh!
Rating: 5, Review: Zaps them quick fast and in a hurry 😂😂
Rating: 5, Review: Easy operation.
Rating: 5, Review: Easy to use and zaps the bugs efficiently. Getting all the bugs out is a bit of a challenge, but not hard to do, if you have the zapper mounted in a easy access place.

Rating: 5, Review: Very nice !
Rating: 5, Review: Recent purchase of GOOTOP Bug Zapper Outdoor Electric has worked great so far hopefully I will be around for years to come
Rating: 2, Review: I purchased this to hang in my patio area and I realized the cord is too short to hang anywhere.
Rating: 1, Review: At first it worked really well, but after 2 or so months the bulb went off, it still zaps but without a bulb it's of no use, if u tap the bottom few times it would turn on again then off, for almost 40$ u would expect something more durable don't waste ur money on this
Rating: 2, Review: I had a bug zapper I bought in 2005 and had plugged in continuously until the bulb died in 2023. I didn’t know at the time you can replace the bulb. I threw it out and bought this replacement in October 2023. It stopped working in April 2024. So, my first zapper lasted 18 years and this one lasted 6 months. I’d say there is room for improvement. This was inside my climate controlled house.
Rating: 1, Review: The problem I have with this product is it would zap the fly but did not kill any flies. The fly was in the trap after being zapped and was still alive. It flew out when I opened the trap. Got a refund for this product.
Rating: 5, Review: Works great!
Rating: 1, Review: ABS plastic outer feels cheap and unsafe.
Rating: 5, Review: The soft blue light attracts and kills bigs quickly. Works well both inside and outside!
Rating: 1, Review: The bulb just fails over and over again. This product is so expensive to maintain that its unwild.. I dont even keep it outside either. Gone throught 4 bulbs in less than a year making this product over priced compared to the higher end ones that held up much better in my home. DONT BUY. Spend more for an actual quality product dont wont just give up after 2 months. Wish they would take this back
Rating: 1, Review: Would not buy again ,,, worked two months.
Rating: 5, Review: I leave it running for about 5 hours each night. Garage is flying bug free now.
Rating: 5, Review: My husband and I like to sit out on our back patio every night but the June bugs, gnats and moths drive us crazy. I bought those little tennis racket zappers for the June bugs but not much you can do for the no see um's. I figured to give a bug zapper another shot. This one is GREAT. I put it at the other end of the patio and the majority of the bugs all stay on that side and get zapped. The best part is that it attracts the June bugs. I think they are a little too big to zap but the light keeps them all over on that side of the patio and then they just die since they only live for 24 hours. I couldn't be happier with this purchase.

And they were just the most uncomfortable pillows I had ever bought the $10 ones were better than the ones they sell at Costco. But after that I was like let me just give in and buy these pillows.

Rating: 2, Review: These pillows are ok for the price; however they definitely didn't offer enough support for a side or back sleeper. They were a lot flatter than I expected. I could feel the mattress using just one and I question how they would hold up over time. I had to use both and I still worke up with a sore neck. I will be returning these pillows and continuing my search.
Rating: 5, Review: I buy pillows about once a year. Don’t judge me, I haven’t found a more expensive brand that Id like to invest in yet. I have been buying these pillows for the past 3 years… and every year they have lasted and held their shape. This year it is very clear that the new quality “standard” has gone down hill, the filling is far less than what it was and I’m paying almost double for less of a pillow. The old one from last year has more volume than the new one, just unpackaged. It’s sad to see companies sell out. I’ll be retuning these and starting the hunt for another good pillow alll over again. It was good while it lasted!
Rating: 1, Review: The pillow is very soft and pillows but I don't feel any firmness at all. I had bamboo pillows that were great but they were old so I saw these and actually had a credit so they came out to be like $11. I would be disappointed if I paid $59.
Rating: 2, Review: Pillows are not as fluffy as the pictures .They are actually pretty flat. Need more filling. Very disappointed in the price for the quality.
Rating: 5, Review: Love these pillows! I've been looking for pillows like these ever since I stayed at a friend's house & slept like a baby with her pillows. She shared the link with me. I purchased them & was NOT disappointed! They feel like hotel pillows! I'm so happy with them.  They don't hold smell. I got the Queen size (2). In my photo I have a satin pillow case over it, but notice it hasn't lost its shape or flattened out & I've had them for abt 6 months.  I used to use down pillows but got tired of the feathers coming out.  Also, you can wash & dry them & they don't get all wonky!
Rating: 5, Review: It is very comfortable
Rating: 5, Review: Great guest pillows!
Rating: 3, Review: The photo online makes the pillow appear to be curved (which is what I wanted as a side sleeper) but it is just rectangular. Very deceiving. I also do not like that pillow cannot go in the dryer after washing---- has to be hung up to dry.
Rating: 5, Review: I've had these pillows for a couple years and they're still fluffy.
Rating: 5, Review: I’ve tested out expensive ergonomic and memory foam pillows ranging 40-70$ a pop and have not had as big of a success story as this. These pillows tuck perfect around my neck to give me the best support. Since purchasing these, I’ve slept through the night and haven’t woken up with ANY pain or discomfort. These pillows are so damn good that I let my roommate borrow one and now I’m trying to convince her to buy her own just so I can get mine back *true story lol*
Rating: 4, Review: My wife loves this pillow more then me and would give it 5 stars. Two weeks into it I find my pillow starting to lose some of its firmness. While this is ok at the point as it was a bit to fluffy to start I am concerned about long term durability.
Rating: 5, Review: Finally, a pillow my husband likes. He’s tried so many, even very expensive ones, but this one has satisfied him. Great pillow!
Rating: 5, Review: I have been searching for an affordable, comfortable pillow. This is the one! I’m a side sleeper and usually toss and turn because the pillow is either too hard or soft and bunchy. I slept like a baby last night because the pillow is divine!
Rating: 4, Review: Slept with pillow three nights now. Very comfortable
Rating: 5, Review: I bought 4 pillows that did not work out. With a tremendous relief this one did. I am very happy. I am mostly a side sleeper.
Rating: 5, Review: Got these in October 2023 and they are still just as big and fluffy, didn’t deflate they are super comfy and I can’t recommend them enough. I used to have to sleep with so many pillows to stay elevated while I slept but now I sleep with these pillows and I got to throw out all the bad ones! No need to hesitate with this buy if it can improve your sleep :)

Rating: 5, Review: This pillow is the perfect balance of support and plushness, it has helped with a restful night's sleep every time.
Rating: 2, Review: I was so eager to get these much needed pillows. The references to 'down' and the thousands of positive reviews (ever notice how EVERY item on Amazon gets a 4 1/2 star review?!). However, when I used these, I found mine very stiff - no 'down' feel at all - and very, very HOT!! I can't even use them! Silly me, I had already thrown the packaging away so now they cannot be returned. I'm so sad, I was so looking forward to these. As a side note: when WILL I learn that reviews come from all types of people with all types of experiences ~ or lack thereof. If you hate 'hot' pillows like I do, beware. If not, they were otherwise nice.
Rating: 1, Review: These were a terrible purchase and a waste of money. They are lumpy and not comfortable at all. There is no support when laying on them either it's like they are just flat.

Rating: 5, Review: The pillowcases arrived quickly and I was very satisfied with them. I read the description wrong and thought I was purchasing a pack of 4 (the queen sized cases came in a pack of 4 which was the search result I clicked on first). It was totally a misunderstanding on my part, but we aware in case you think you are ordering four.
Rating: 5, Review: I have special pillows for my neck, and my cats were picking holes in the pillowcases. I bought these pillowcases to replace the other ones, and they are more comfortable than the original ones now I make sure I put throw blankets over my pillows so my cat can’t pull material.

Rating: 3, Review: Nice fabric, but run shorter than most pillowcases
Rating: 3, Review: These pillowcases started to show wear after a fee washings. They are thinner than our other pillowcases. I will look for a different option next time.
Rating: 5, Review: I purchased these because of the envelope feature, and I have since purchased a 2nd set. They are by far the most comfortable and the softest pillow cases I have every had. I have no doubt I will purchase many more. They are not heavy or thick but they are sooo soft..!!!
Rating: 5, Review: Great material &quality I highly recommend! These are for king size pillows true to size.
Rating: 5, Review: The pillows came shrink wrapped and a inch thick. I wondered how this pillow would ever fluff up. As soon as you open the package it immediately stated to go to its original size and within a minute was perfect in size and the comfort was amazing.
Rating: 5, Review: These are inexpensive so I was prepared for poor quality and a rough texture. WRONG! so so soft! Love them!!
Rating: 5, Review: I love the color and quality!
Rating: 5, Review: Nice pillow covers.
Rating: 3, Review: Not up to your quality standards
Rating: 2, Review: They ARE soft, wrinkle-free, and easy care --- BUT they slide off the pillows and you end up with half a pillow or more that has NO covering --- which is especially odd because they are designed with a pocketed opening which should stop the problem --- but it doesn't! Soft, wrinkle free, and easy care are irrelevant when yu wake up with a pillowcase on the floor or someplace else that it shouldn't be.
Rating: 3, Review: The material is soft but they are cheaply made. I am having to add something to the end to cover the pillow and enhance the case. The colors are pretty so it should be easy enough to add to them for function and prettiness.

Rating: 1, Review: Customer servicer STINKS! After several months of use this coffeemaker stopped working. I called the number listed and was asked a bunch of stupid questions like: Did I plug it in, is the outlet working, etc. I was given a number to write down and tape to the front of the machine. Then take several pictures and email this to the company which I did several weeks ago and have not heard a thing. I emailed them several times and no response. I will never buy another one of these cheaply made coffeemakers!

Rating: 1, Review: Bought the machine for the ease of making a single fresh cup of coffee. After cleaning the machine as it prompted, the next cup of coffee never brewed. Machine won't turn on at all. Pretty ridiculous for a name brand item and the cost. Honestly feel like I was sold a refurbished version or something. I will definitely not purchase another Kuerig device again.

Rating: 3, Review: It's waterproof, it would probably work in a tub. I'm using it in a shower stall. The weights are tiny, the plastic is very lightweight and the shower steam actually blows the curtain out of the stall. Heading to the the hardware store to buy some washers for additional weight so it will remain in the stall. Would not buy again

Our county water has a distinct chemical taste that she loathed. When the person with the well went on vacation I was stuck. She said to order the pitcher. It filters so well- water quality is MUCH better. No chlorine odor or taste. Not going back! Will order again. Also the size fits so well in the fridge.
Rating: 2, Review: The lid does not seal therefore you CANNOT pour the brita while there is still water in the top

Rating: 2, Review: My daughter ordered this Brita for her dorm room. It arrived with a crack in the bottom. She can’t return it as there is no Wholefoods or UPS near her dorm. Taking an Uber would cost her more than the Brita itself. She’s going to try and use tape to see if it will work otherwise she’s going to have to toss it.
Rating: 5, Review: Giving this a shot, so far so good. Nice deal
Rating: 4, Review: First time user. Our condo has really heavy water. Drinking and cooking water much better using the Britta. Pleased I got one.
Rating: 4, Review: The cleaning and prepping part was easy. You have to let the filter run 3 times before use. However, in order to have a full pitcher, you must fill the top two (maybe 3 times). You fill the top, let it filter down, then refill it. The first fill will only get you a third/a half pitcher.
Rating: 5, Review: Fantastic purchase! Just the right size to have in refrigerator for Pup and me. Love how easy it is to fill and keep filtered water readily available. Both of us are drinking more H2O since our tap water doesn't taste that great. Def recommend. May buy as gifts for others this summer.

I’ve followed the laundering instructions on this and my insert has ripped after 2 washes… super disappointing because the comfort is great. The filling is able to come out and it’s not repairable by sewing sadly.

Rating: 5, Review: I had a duvet cover I really liked but needed an insert for my queen bed. I saw this had good reviews on Amazon so I gave it a shot. It is the duvet insert for the bed in my guest room, so I have never personally slept with it, but I have had no complaints. It is is easy to slip into the cover, and machine washable which makes it easy to clean after each of my guests leaves.
Rating: 1, Review: I have had this comforter for 2 months and it’s ripped. Not happy can’t return and upset.
Rating: 5, Review: Are you in search of a versatile and practical duvet insert? Look no further as this product is perfect for you. It is suitable for those who have started to accumulate many duvets and require an insert that delivers quality and value. This particular duvet insert has loops on all four corners to ensure it stays in place, providing just the right amount of warmth for spring and summer. For people living in states that are not too cold, this duvet insert could also work for fall. However, it is not suitable for winter as it is not extremely warm. Overall, if you are looking for a duvet insert that is comfortable, practical, and affordable, this product is definitely worth considering.

I think at first I had it upside down so I flipped it over. It was even worse the correct way! I could never sleep in that thing so I took it off. Tried to pawn it off on my sleeping daughter that was doing just fine flopping around and sleeping. Once she used the pillow she couldn’t sleep any more. So then we got my cousin to take it and she absolutely hated it too. 0/3 of us would recommend this pillow.
Rating: 1, Review: I use these to sleep on because regular pillows hurt my neck. I've had this product for 5 days and it broke in half.... uhm ok.
Rating: 5, Review: I absolutely love this neck pillow. Very comfortable and flexible. I just ordered a second one.

Rating: 1, Review: Too big. Not comfortable for anyone.
Rating: 2, Review: Not comfortable at all. I was not able to rest easily with this pillow at all; gave very little support, which was surprising because it seemed so stable/sturdy. I never write reviews, but I had to come back here to say this was not a good purchase and wish I could return it. Felt like I was choking when the pulls were together, but I needed it tight for the support. The only good thing was I could pivot and fold the pillow under itself to make it slightly useful.
Rating: 5, Review: This is so much better than the old-school neck pillows. It has a lot more structure and the snap enclosure helps support your neck. We used it on vacation and it was perfect.
Rating: 4, Review: I was a little worried when I pulled this out of the carry sack on the plane and my husband rolled his eyes like that’s never going back in that bag. Good luck. I wasn’t blessed with a long neck and so this kind of chokes me a bit. But it worked and to my surprise went right back in the carry bag.
Rating: 2, Review: These are meant for use on a flight but after using them on a round trip they do not work on flights at all. the back is too stiff and causes your neck to push too far forward when sitting in a plane chair. Very uncomfortable and i will not use them again.
Rating: 5, Review: Best travel pillow I have ever had. Thank you!
Rating: 5, Review: Bought his for an upcoming 18 hour trip out of the country I have.  I took the same trip 7 months ago and wanted to see if I can get better sleep with a neck pillow this time around.  Received it today and ended up doing a test drive in my car for a nap.  BEST THING EVER. Fell asleep immediately and extremely comfortable.  I don’t have experience with other pillows so I don’t have anything to compare to.  Pillow came with a bag and is extremely soft and seems to be real memory foam. The description indicated the inner area is magnetic or cooling. I don’t have that experience, however am not too picky about that.  Highly recommend for the price point.
Rating: 5, Review: Best pillow ever.
Rating: 5, Review: This is THE best neck pillow. I’ve been on multiple 10+ hour flights and can always fall asleep. You will have to shake me to wake up for that mid-flight meal with this bad boy on.  It’s super supportive from all angles. I’ve tried the regular donut looking ones and the tiktok one that looks like a neck brace and this is definitely superior as the pillow is much taller. I would just make sure to wash and travel with it in its cloth pouch so it maintains its shape and will last longer. Mine lasted over two years and only broke because I didn’t handle with care. Will be repurchasing!
Rating: 3, Review: It’s ok-not shaped in a way I find comfortable as a small woman
Rating: 3, Review: I personally found it to be a little to big to be comfortable. I am a 5ft 9 woman of normal size and it was to tall especially in the front on my chin.

Rating: 4, Review: Cute pillow but not that comfortable. I felt like it wasn’t very supportive during my flight.
Rating: 5, Review: Great for a plane, comfortable, has clips to attach to carry bag
Rating: 5, Review: Got this for my boyfriend, and he loves it! He can now fall asleep in the car and no longer complain that his neck hurts when he uses it. Very supportive in the neck area and isn't too high or low. The indents makes it easy to wear this multiple ways. Highly recommend!
Rating: 4, Review: I thought it was going to be a winner. Not. The first flight it was okay, and I got a little sleep. The second flight, my neck was killing me. It is also very cumbersome. I will be tossing it out. I'll either go with the cheaper travel pillow or try the trtl (a little pricey) which has great reviews (I should have spent the extra money).
Rating: 5, Review: Absolutely love love love this memory foam travel neck pillow! It's a game-changer for long journeys, providing unparalleled comfort and support. The memory foam molds perfectly to my neck, relieving pressure points and ensuring a restful sleep. Plus, the soft, plush cover adds an extra layer of coziness. Compact and easy to carry, this pillow has become my must-have travel companion. Say goodbye to stiff necks and hello to blissful travels!
Rating: 5, Review: Love the neck pillow!! It holds up very well!!

Rating: 5, Review: This is an unusual bouquet to send through the mail and these were received with much enthusiasm and there isn’t the care involved as with real flowers. The card stock is quality and the flower detail is amazing. The beautiful shades of pink make for a gorgeous display that will last for a long time. It’s truly a gift that keeps on giving. It had to travel through the mail over three thousand miles and to make sure it arrived intact, I placed it in a large padded envelope (Avery-Amazon) and printed Do Not Bend on the outside and all arrived in perfect condition. The charge to mail this was 5.00 but a lot less expensive including the card than buying real flowers and it will give the recipient lasting enjoyment with wonderful and thoughtful memories of the sender. Highly Recommend!!

Rating: 5, Review: Sealing packages or taping the envelope to the door with the weeks payment for the lawn guy. It’s the best scotch tape brand and size I’ve ever encountered in 61 years of life. The thin 1/2” stuff is a joke and other brands are even sticky or too thin to not break as you’re pulling it off the roll.
Rating: 5, Review: I like to container that the tape is in because it’s easy to tear off. The size is great for my drawer to put in and I did get a better value for my money than in the regular store.
Rating: 5, Review: The media could not be loaded. I suggest to buy one of these.
Rating: 5, Review: I ship a lot and this holds up well, have tried many and this wins…hands down!
Rating: 4, Review: The dispenser is terrible!!! Tape does stick well, it sticks to itself annoyingly.
Rating: 2, Review: I use a lot of these for my business, and know how they're supposed to smell. This last one I received reeks of cigarette smell, it's awful.
Rating: 5, Review: Works perfectly for packaging boxes, or envelopes. The tape sticks well and doesn't peel off. Definitely recommend.
Rating: 4, Review: Used for shipping
Rating: 5, Review: Heavy duty tape ....I will not use any other kind.
Rating: 5, Review: Exactly what I expected for a good price and very quick shipping that I didn't have to grab at the store myself.  We're in the middle of a big move and I ordered this to arrive on my day off so I could just get straight to packing. It does the job and has quite a bit of tape which lasted for many many boxes. Will definitely be buying again as soon as this one gets low!
Rating: 5, Review: We use a lot of tape in my house for taping up packages and boxes. This is my go-to tape for that, it’s good quality and you can find it at a good price.
Rating: 4, Review: Es pequeña
Rating: 5, Review: Sticky as advertised. I definitely use much less tape when I use Scotch brand. Easy to use after you remove the starter tab and feed it in the included dispenser. Clean cuts. The feed part helps to find the tape after you are done. 10/10 compared to my other go to tapes. Just wish it was a larger roll.
Rating: 1, Review: Impossible to figure out
Rating: 4, Review: Does what it is suppose to do! Great tape
Rating: 5, Review: great product for the value. i am not paying ups for the tape anymore lol
Rating: 5, Review: Strong tape and it last long! You get a lot of tape for the money and it's easy to rip. The size also works well because it's not too wide nor too thin so it's perfect for taping up boxes or anything else.
Rating: 4, Review: The dispenser works well as long as you pass the tape through the catches. Be mindful of the length in feet. This can likely seal a 10-12 large boxes or packages.
Rating: 5, Review: Tried and true product
Rating: 5, Review: Is easy to use and seals well.

Rating: 5, Review: Perfect for taking notes
Rating: 5, Review: Nice
Rating: 5, Review: The media could not be loaded. These notepads are a thinner paper. When using a pen you will notice that you can see the outline of text on the next page. It will bleed through if you decide to use a sharpie. I like these pads because they are convenient and a great value. You get six pads in total. I enjoy the different colors and the line spacing.
Rating: 4, Review: Great value for everyday needs but beware that if you want to tear off the pages and have them look nice that it will not happen. They will rip. The cardboard isn’t very thick but we use in portfolios so it doesn’t matter.
Rating: 1, Review: The pack of notepads arrived. Several tops of the notepads were not even attached correctly, stapled to the front, covering the paper, or the top part not attached at all. Had to return them.
Rating: 5, Review: Great product great price
Rating: 4, Review: Great for work or personal great price
Rating: 2, Review: Ink bleeds through, pages don't tear easily, lines are wonky on some pads, and others are... interesting??? (see pic)
Rating: 5, Review: Pages don't rip clean off like a standard yellow pad. Perforation is 1/4"" below the black binding and this causes pages to rip after using 3 sheets from the pad. Spend a few extra pennies and get a quality product.
Rating: 5, Review: I work from home and I’m on the phone a lot. These small pads of paper help me make notes during my conversations. They also help me prepare for my day before I start working. I’ve been buying for five years. Will continue to buy.
Rating: 5, Review: I like the size of these pads. They come in so handy. I keep one in select rooms in my home. I’m always needing to jot down a note or take notes on a project. Love these! Love the colors!

Perfect size, great quality. I’ve purchased these many times.
Rating: 4, Review: Not much tape per roll- comparison shop a bit.
Rating: 3, Review: I found myself using more tape to pack my moving boxes wasnt strong tape to feel confident that my things would hold up a move, will come back to give an update, crossing my fingers
Rating: 5, Review: I have been using this product for over the 10 past years to ship stuff I've sold online and it's never failed me. I've seen other people use different brands of packing tape and this time of Scotch packing tape is by the best I've seen. I will never buy a different brand of packing tape. I know it's more expensive than other brands, but the quality of this tape can't be beat.
Rating: 5, Review: I’m not sure what I can say except that it works. We have all used box tape and I needed multiple rolls. Will buy again when I need more tape.
Rating: 5, Review: Each dispenser is self contained but can be kept for refills. Much easier to handle than the bigger ones. Great for small hands.
Rating: 5, Review: Pro: Creates a fortress-like seal on all box types, ensuring your packages stay secure during transit.  Con: Dispenser occasionally requires a bit of finagling to get started, but once it's rolling, it's smooth sailing.  Overall the clear tape blends seamlessly with any packaging, adding a polished, professional touch to your parcels. Great adhesion (This tape's seal is so strong, it could probably keep a treasure chest shut tight... or at least your neighbor's nosy cat out of your packages!)
Rating: 5, Review: Taped up a bunch of already used cardboard boxes for our move across town. Made it lots easier than wrestling with ordinary rolls of tape.

Rating: 5, Review: I like the facts that I’m able to use these everywhere , in the refrigerator , in the bathroom , in drawers.
Rating: 1, Review: Got these to help me organize my drawers in the office. Don’t waste your money. They’re cheap flimsy moves around.
Rating: 5, Review: These containers fit all of the drawers and comes with not slip stickers. which I did not realize was needed.
Rating: 5, Review: I loved these organizers so much!! It comes with a variety of sizes and clear, easy to use anti-slip grips. It was perfect to keep my makeup vanity clean and organized.
Rating: 5, Review: Just what I wanted to organize my bathroom drawers. I will also use in my ""junk"" drawer.
Rating: 1, Review: I imagined these to ""fit"" with each other but the design is such that the boxes don't align in the drawers. The edges aren't straight but sloped so there's an annoying gap of unused space between the boxes. They're also quite flimsy. I do not recommend these unfortunately.
Rating: 5, Review: I used the organizers in my Ikea MALM dresser and they fit nicely. I was able to switch up placement and still keep the organized look. I’ve had organizers before but by far these were the ones that looked the best since they were clear. I did buy the package that came with the most since I did need more than anticipated. I always say it’s better to have more of the product rather than not have enough. Out of the other organizers these are definitely the best ones I’ve used. They are way to assemble since they come with stickers to prevent them from sliding and the quality is great, feels sturdy and not cheap.
Rating: 5, Review: My vanity never looked so good, happily organized.
Rating: 5, Review: The media could not be loaded. These happen to for perfectly for a sewing desk we put together. I love how clean the clear containers look in the drawer.
Rating: 5, Review: Love these sets. Was able to organize my vanity drawers for all my needs. Makes everything have a place and easy to locate what I'm needing.
Rating: 5, Review: This keeps all your drawers organized I really like my purchase I recommend it to you guys 100%
Rating: 4, Review: They are smaller than I thought but that is my bad. I needed them to help organize my pantry, so at least I could fit the small items.
Rating: 5, Review: Really great sizes and versatile. Works well with my new bathroom and vanity and storage cabinet. Nice and tidy
Rating: 5, Review: Several different sizes
Rating: 5, Review: Nothing
Rating: 4, Review: I thought these would be a pretty clear green but they are more of a solid plastic color. They are great little storage boxes though.
Rating: 5, Review: Really liked that these little containers were sturdy and the different sizes are great for storing or sorting out your junk drawers or hair barrettes and hair binders, or anything else you want to keep straight in your drawers. Easy to find what you’re looking for!
Rating: 5, Review: very sturdy
Rating: 1, Review: These are useless VERY tiny your not putting anything in these maybe some tacks Def not socks Waste in my opinion
Rating: 3, Review: These containers themselves are good. Lots of varying sizes which I love, but they slide around every time I open and close the drawers even with the rubber stickers it comes with. It drives me nuts to be honest.
Rating: 5, Review: use them at my work bench, easy to figure out
Rating: 5, Review: This keeps all my facial products and other things organized and easy to find
Rating: 4, Review: So at the time I bought this to organize desk stuff. I would not order this for office organizing. But I’m not even sure what you would use it for makeup either since it says in the description. The lengths done fit much.
Rating: 5, Review: These worked perfect to organize my kitchen a d bathroom drawers. The variety of sizes was very useful for the different items I was using for.
Rating: 5, Review: Very sturdy. Bumpers for the bottom make it so they don't move around. Easy to switch around depending on needs. I should have bought more sets.
Rating: 5, Review: This was perfect for smaller items in my baby’s room. This product is on the smaller side and not made for bigger items so pay attention to the dimensions. Adhesive dots are included to prevent sliding that you can stick at the bottom of each piece as well.
Rating: 3, Review: Honestly, the size and shape of these are too small and virtually useless. I’ve tried them in so many different drawers and cabinets and they’re just really disappointing. The little rubber feet stickers you can add to the bottom are nice
Rating: 5, Review: It.comes with small silicone stickers so it won't slide
Rating: 3, Review: It said it came with 200 extra silicone feet and I only got 50. But other than that the organizers are great

Color is great and helped to create personalized comfort in new sterile looking cubical. Unrolled easily with no issues with curling up. So glad I purchased this!
Rating: 1, Review: When I first unboxed this desk mat, I thought it was perfect to put under my laptop with a larger mouse area next to the computer, exactly what I wanted and ordered. The mat was great the first two days, no edge curling, comfortable sliding for my mouse and a pretty color, plus it did not have any odor. I put nothing on it other than the mouse and laptop. I didn't wipe it down before using it, never put anything hot or cold on it, but all edges are curling up, making it very uncomfortable for my wrists to rest on. I'm so disappointed! I'd return it, but it's such a hassle!
Rating: 5, Review: A very great product and easy to clean.
Rating: 5, Review: Love this. It not only looks nice it protects my computer desk. It’s just the right thickness. My husband likes to put his coffee cup or water bottle on the computer desk and it was ruining the desk. Now I don’t have to worry about it. And it wipes off easily. Also I don’t need a mouse pad.
Rating: 5, Review: I shouldve bought one of these a long time ago to protect my table from my computer set up. Been using a couple weeks with no complaints
Rating: 5, Review: I love the pink color. It looks nice on a white desktop. It lays flat and provides a nice writing/work service.
Rating: 5, Review: this is a great pad for my office
Rating: 5, Review: Attractive and good value
Rating: 5, Review: I got this for the office and it’s great quality once it’s flattened out. It doesn’t hold indentations easily, and it’s a great product for the money. The color is exactly how it was displayed in the stock photos!
Rating: 5, Review: I used it to replace a mouse pad that was never where I wanted it. This pad works perfectly.
Rating: 5, Review: The media could not be loaded. Great mat. Used it for my vanity. Easy to clean, durable and lightweight. It stays in place with no moving. 10 out of 10.
Rating: 3, Review: This is a nice pad. However, it is not as smooth as thought. It is rough and snags my mouse every time I try to do something. I ended up going back to my old desk pad. I gave it three stars only because I like the design and wish it would work better.
Rating: 5, Review: Almost fits my entire 55inch desk. It fits my monitor and big wacom cintiq. My old mousepad was the same kind but smaller, and my monitors would hang off of it. For the color and size I wanted, the quality is good. Definitely longer lasting mousepads out there, my last one was under constant use for 3ish years before it began to peel.
Rating: 5, Review: It works great for me and my bulky computer setup.  It’s not leather, luckily.  It fattened out well after a while.
Rating: 5, Review: I like the feel of it. I hate using just a mouse pad and protecting my desk. I like the back too - it doesn’t slide around. It was a little darker than I thought. But it looks great!
Rating: 4, Review: I like it makes my desk cute
Rating: 1, Review: I had this on my desk for not a long time before little marks appeared. Everything else easily left marks. Hard to clean. If you get one little pen mark on it nothing gets it off. Even tried rubbing alcohol.
Rating: 5, Review: Prevents damage of wooden desk surface. Easy to clean.
Rating: 5, Review: Works great for those working on 2+ monitors
Rating: 5, Review: Exactly what I expected, which is a nice surprise. It comes folded in a roll, but it has no marks and stays flat as you take it off its packaging. It looks and works great, and its cheap. 100% recommended.
Rating: 5, Review: I love the color. It’s nice and pliable. Great for the desk. I can write on paper with it and the pen doesn’t break through.
Rating: 5, Review: Came in as described and the exact color that was shown in the photos. I’ve had it for almost a year and it has held up well. It is durable and cleans easily. I use it at the office daily and love it.

Rating: 5, Review: I ordered these sheets to use with a sublimation hack I read about how to sublimate onto Dollar Tree trivets and it worked like a charm. These sheets were the most reasonable priced I could find ANYWHERE. If course they also work great in my 8x10 laminating machine too! Large package will certainly last me a long time no matter what I use them for.

Rating: 5, Review: Great price. Work very well.
Rating: 5, Review: Good value for the money
Rating: 1, Review: Pouches wrinkled while going through the laminator. The pouches are too thin. I had previously purchased this item and quality/thickness is definitely lacking!
Rating: 5, Review: Purchased it with the Laminator Machine 13 Inch from Amazon. The paper has a great weight. Very easy to open. Heated up really nice and did not get jammed in machine for that smooth finish. We use it for school projects, work and crafting. Very versatile and worth the money.
Rating: 4, Review: AMOUNT FOR YOUR MONEY and THICKNESS - You get a good number of sheets for your money but the thickness is closer to your name brand 3 mil than it is 5 mil. HEATING - Heating is decent but I had a few that cams out abnormally wrinkly after running it one time, so I ended up making another set. JAMMING - I have not had a single jam until I switched to this brand. It happens about every 1 in 30 laminates. OVERALL - I’d probably by these again for backup or for my laminating projects that don’t exactly require a nice sturdy sheet.
Rating: 5, Review: Easy to use. Came out nice and clear!
Rating: 1, Review: These laminating sheets were the worse I have ever bought . Very thin and peels after heating . Everything that I used these sheets for came apart . Do not recommend !

Rating: 1, Review: Defective black ink. I put a new cartridge in and it's not printing. The Color ones were fine.
Rating: 2, Review: The ink seemed good quality but the quantity is another story. Received the HP 67 black/color cartridges in March 2024. Mainly used to print out taxes and did not use much to date, May 6, 2024 I am already out of ink so I feel the value is lacking.

Rating: 1, Review: Ink is a racket!
Rating: 1, Review: I bought on Amazon thinking I would get an actual cartridge full of ink. I was wrong. Now I have to go buy another refill somewhere else because this one had little to no ink in it. I am highly disappointed.
Rating: 1, Review: Ran great for the first few documents but the print quality started getting lines and evidence of dirty printing heads only 20 or so pages in. I kept running the printer head clean and secondary clean cycles, nothing helped. The hp smart software indicated the ink still had over 50% left but all my documents kept printing with streaks of missing ink and lines missing. I even tried physically wiping down the printer heads after with a qtip. I spent all this money on the official hp ink and official hp paper to avoid this mess and I think the knock offs would have lasted longer at this point.  Since I had it stored for a few months before installing, I'm past the return window.

It cost $4.00 to mail (USPS) but worth it to make my old mum happy.
Rating: 5, Review: I sent several of these paper bouquets out for Mother's Day this year, and they are beautiful! My elderly Grandmother was able to assemble it without trouble. It does take more than the 4 stamps recommended, but it was well worth the shipping cost (around $4-$5). I made sure to write ""Do Not Bend"" on both sides of the envelope as well. Love these!
Rating: 1, Review: I bought 3 of these thinking that they would be amazing. They came and the peices just fell apart when i tried to see what my mothers experience would be. So poorly made and fell over flat and awful would not stand ubtil i taped the pieces together. The come with a rubberband that is to big to hold them round enough to stand. A nightmare..never again… my mom and motherinlaw would have never been able to put these together on their own. I just ordered love pop..i dont care if they are twice the price. They are worth it
Rating: 1, Review: Ripped it trying to open it. Pinch here? What do you mean pinch here???? That does nothing!!! Then when I tore the stickers off it ripped it some more. Can't even present this to mom. It's going straight in the trash!!!!!!!!

Rating: 5, Review: Bought a group of 3 and love them all - great colors and big enough to show off. Price was good too, since regular cards go for at least half without the wow factor.

Rating: 5, Review: These are such a great gift!! My mom LOVED them! Perfect bc she doesn’t like maintaining plants and she’s always worrried about her cats eating flowers she gets. This was great!!
Rating: 5, Review: I was skeptical because I seen some not so good reviews. And since this is for Mother’s Day, I didn’t want to be disappointed since I’m ordering a couple of days away… Received the package and it’s SO NICE!

Rating: 4, Review: Its quite pretty and the graphics are nice. I like how it pops open with A push pull tab on the bottom rather than the rubber band method. My only gripe is that it has a seem running straight down the middle. Its not TOO bad but still soemwhat noticeable.

Rating: 5, Review: I loved this It is going to my mom
Rating: 3, Review: The Mother’s Day card with the beautiful flowers was awesome. However, it was shipped through the post office and they bent it to fit it in the mailbox. The bend was right through the middle of the card and it doesn’t stand up right now. It would have been perfect if they had shipped it with an Amazon driver and in a box. It was only shipped in a plastic envelope which could easily be bent. I had bought this card to ship to my sister who had lost her daughter a couple years ago and I know she would’ve loved it. Could not send it to her, even if I had put it in a box because it was bent in the middle. Even though the card was bent, it is a beautiful flowers are gorgeous card. So if you buy those card and they say it’s going to be shipped through the positive post office no it’s not going to come in a box and hopefully yours won’t get bent.
Rating: 5, Review: They both were loved!
Rating: 5, Review: Honestly, these are better than flowers! I received a pop up flower arrangement and keep it on my desk. Love it!
Rating: 5, Review: It’s a very stunning card, I sent it in the mail to my mother. The only curious point I had was how to maintain the cards 3D shape. There isn’t really any good instructions that are given. But it also comes with a giant large nice envelope too, perfect for mailing it off to someone special. Paper and print is super high quality too. I would definitely buy again!
Rating: 3, Review: Loved the Grande Bouquet with it's amazing base that is sturdy and substantial. Was excited to try this smaller size to take to my niece in the hospital. The bottom didn't pop into shape and seemed a lot less sturdy. Beautiful but kept tipping over. I should have got the larger size. Be nice to have another size in between, cost goes from $12 to $35. Where's the $25? Just a thought, this one disappointed.
Rating: 5, Review: I am giving this bouquet to my best friend to celebrate her birthday.
Rating: 5, Review: These fold out cards are so real like and beautiful. People I buy them for smile and love them. Almost more than the present! Its a piece of artwork that guarantees to make someone happy! Amazon is the Best Place to find them!
Rating: 5, Review: This pop up boutique was truly beautiful! It made the perfect “Mother’s Day” card. The colors were vibrant and the flowers were lovely. The mailing envelope the boutique folded into was bright pink and very large making it a delightful surprise to receive. I would definitely consider purchasing other boutiques to send on special occasions. The price was very reasonable.

I do pay for extra to make it a picture frame so it fixes in more as decoration.
Rating: 2, Review: My wife and I were looking forward to this for our home and our 2 kids. I am afraid it was a disappointment.  The Bad: 1) The keyboard is hands down the most unresponsive touch screen I have seen in over a decade. It takes two minutes to type ""Soccer Game - Field 3"". This is the single reason we are returning. It is horrible. All 4 of our family members tested it to make sure it was same for all of us. 2) There is no auto correct/spell check. With kids using this and others with dyslexia (or just general horrible spelling) why in gods name was this not added!? 3) It won't capitalize the 1st letter of 1st word in each event. This is a small thing - but I don't want my calendar to look like a 12 year old made it, all in lower case unless you use slower than molasses keyboard to capitalize each word. 4) You cannot customize the views of the calendar (specific number of days to view) or view just the weekend ect. 5) No alarms! 6) No voice to text!!! This is crazy! 7) No battery at all - 100% had to be on a wall at all times. 8) No Widgets or apps- I would PAY for them! 9) Calendar will not allow you repeat events like a google/apple calendar will (example: every Thursday or 1st of each month ect) - lack of specific repeating events is mind boggling. 10) You cannot view the weekly weather. Or any variation of the weather.  The Good: 1) It's heavy and well built 2) It looks clean 3) Easy setup  This is a great 1st edition. Call me when it has 2 or 3 revolutions to add some functionality and I will be back....for $250.

Rating: 5, Review: My wife had been writing out on a dry erase board every month. This is just great to use the Skylight. Whole soccer schedule - ENTERED! I prefer entering via my phone, others are ok with the actual device. I wish the device had speech to text, then I may use it directly. I am scared if their server goes down. . .. tragedy would strike.
Rating: 5, Review: I travel for work and it's great to be able to have a hub for a calender that can be seen on my phone. Chore list and shopping list are great to keep everyone on the same page and everything in one app
Rating: 1, Review: Did not work with my iPhone. Not and intuitive design, you have to email yourself a link into your calendar?! Why isn’t it just a button? On top of all that there’s a monthly subscription for this archaic service that doesn’t even work. Pathetic. Returning immediately.
Rating: 5, Review: We've had many visual calendars over the years. When my sons learned to read we started doing a white board calendar. I got so tired of updating it daily with the entire play by play schedule, especially when I'm taking that play by play directly from my Google Calendar off my phone. I started looking into digital calendars. I preferred the price of the 10 inch calendar but really felt we needed a larger one closer the 15 in. The price seemed a bit excessive to me so I waited for a few weeks on this Calendar. I finally convinced myself this would be an investment that will last for years and solve a problem for years to come. We got it last week and I'm very happy we did. It's very easy to use, easy to set up, and straightforward. The kids love it and already use it and go to it the same way they always have for their visual schedules. This is already making my job a lot easier. Glad to retire the white board.
Rating: 3, Review: Notifications are constantly going off at the wrong time. They are supposed to go off at ten minutes before and during. They will either not go off at all or go off only ten minutes AFTER or go off ten minutes before but not during. I hope this company gets their act together. We’ve been trying everything we read on their site to troubleshoot this product. Hopefully customer service will be able to help us but they were down for maintenance the other day when I tried.
Rating: 5, Review: A house of two adults and three active kids, this is ideal for keeping scheduling straight and chore lists. We are still ""breaking"" ours in, but the set up is really easy. Functionality wise it is really simple, I just wish the calendar link when making an event in the Skylight App was more accepting of edits. I.E. if you don't chose a synced calendar at time of creation you will need to delete the event and add it again. Plus you cannot select more than one synced calendar. Those are my only gripes so far.
Rating: 5, Review: I have 3 children who are incredibly active with before and after school activities. I also have a husband with short term memory loss (😂) I needed a visual calendar that was easily accessible for my husband and 3 kids. Bonus that it has a chore tab my kids can access, and extra bonus it syncs up to my iPhone calendar. This is a must for every parent who manages their household. So happy with it! I’m debating on whether or not to subscribe to the photo addition - price is actually reasonable!
Rating: 5, Review: Love it, it has everything I need.
Rating: 5, Review: I debated buying this for months. It is pricey but worth it. This has drastically helped with keeping the kids on task with chores and daily tasks. It’s very easy to use. Love the app because I can add chores as I think of them and the kids can get started when they get home. I also add chores for myself and my husband for the weekend as I think of them. We often discuss what needs to be done but forget by the weekend. My only negative would be that I didn’t realize there was a monthly charge on top of the cost of the calendar itself. Just be aware before buying
Rating: 5, Review: Perfect for someone like me that has an extensive work schedule, children’s activities etc. everything is in one place…I do wish there were a few extra options and settings but I love it none the less!
Rating: 5, Review: Our family finally has organization for our crazy schedules. With color coding and phone calendar connections, everyone knows what’s going on.  And the chore chart has been an unexpected blessing. No one forgets or complains!  Definitely a must have for a busy family!
Rating: 5, Review: Tired of crumpled up paper lists and calendars that never seem to be on the right month? This is an absolute must have family organizer! Especially for OCD moms like myself. This is a quality product that is easy to use. I just downloaded the app and clicked a few buttons to sync my iCloud calendars. You can also manually input on the device screen. My kids love the virtual list for chores and the gratification of checking the chores off. My husband can now know and see our schedule every morning when he makes coffee. No more man excuses of “I had no idea we had dinner planned with your mom”. Now even the dogs know what’s happening on the daily. You can subscribe to Skylight (for a fee) for more features. I am perfectly satisfied with the free basic features of this device. This would make a wonderful Mother’s Day gift. Wink wink. Even for the price of this product, I am a happy customer. Cheers!
Rating: 5, Review: My 5 year old son was really struggling every day with not knowing what was going to happen that day (karate after school? someone's birthday party? mom and dad's date night?) and in the morning rush to get to school, my husband and I weren't amazing at remembering to tell him what he had in store every day. Now he walks out of his room every morning and the first thing he does is check this calendar. It's super easy to update and keep synced from my phone and computer. We use emojis in the calendar titles, which he thinks is fun and helps him since he's still learning to read. This has been so helpful! EVERYONE is less stressed, my son included.
Rating: 5, Review: It’s kept our chores organized, the kids motivated, the lists organized, and we all know the plans! I couldn’t love any device more than this one!!!
Rating: 4, Review: I think that for the price you should be able to put pictures on it without having to pay extra.

Rating: 5, Review: The HP 67XL Black High-yield Ink Cartridge is a true lifesaver for anyone who relies on their HP printer for everyday tasks. With its high-yield capacity, this cartridge ensures that you can print more pages without the hassle of frequent replacements. The rich, deep black ink produces sharp and crisp text, making every document look professional and polished. I've been consistently impressed by the longevity of this cartridge, as well as its reliability in delivering high-quality prints every time. Plus, installation is a breeze, thanks to HP's user-friendly design. Whether you're printing reports, essays, or photographs, the HP 67XL Black High-yield Ink Cartridge is a dependable choice that won't disappoint. It's a must-have for anyone seeking convenience, quality, and value in their printing supplies.
Rating: 5, Review: Easy install
Rating: 1, Review: HP printers and ink are absolutely the reason I refuse to purchase HP products. Their focus is 100% on recurring revenue, and because of that, their product quality suffers. This Envy printer I was given uses the 67XL cartridges, and while setting it up, I was pestered countless times to subscribe to their print supplies service. I print as infrequently as possible because inkjet printers are some of the biggest money-sucks that exist, so I declined the subscription prompt every time and came here to buy a couple of cartridges. When I finally had enough things I needed to print, I pulled the ink out of the package, popped it in, and got maybe 10 or 12 clean pages out of it in the following month before it stopped working.  The HP Smart app that you're required to use did absolutely nothing to help, even with its level 1 and 2 cleaning cycles; and even though the app shows the ""estimated ink level"" to be almost completely full, that cartridge is barely outputting any ink. At about 2 bucks a page, I'd say the cartridge isn't very cost effective. I guess if I would have just subscribed to their printer supplies program, I'd have another ready to go and wouldn't care that I only got 12 pages out of it. Between that and blocking out third party ink cartridges, I'd say they're pretty much forcing people into their printer subscriptions.  I wouldn't recommend this product or anything else HP makes.

Rating: 5, Review: I was looking for a renter friendly way to hang these curtains (with out drilling into the walls) and came across this tape. I was skeptical it would work due to the uneven popcorn ceilings - but boy was I wrong! Almost 6 months later and these curtains are hanging strong! So impressed with this tape. Highly recommend!
Rating: 5, Review: This is just an extremely convenient thing to have around. I used it to hold Ring window/door opening detectors which didn't have enough glue. I used it to hold a Raspberry Pi case on the wall behind my TV. It doesn't peel off paint, it's super easy to remove, yet super strong. Highly recommend.
Rating: 4, Review: Great tape for low weight items. I rated a 4 because it is too pricey for what it is.
Rating: 3, Review: It has a very strong hold. That’s good. You don’t have to worry about your pictures falling in an earthquake. BUT, the información says it’s easy to take off and won’t ruin your wall. That is INCORRECT. we removed a picture and it tore pieces off of the wall.
Rating: 2, Review: I tried to use this instead of the command strips, and it does stick some of the time. But the other times, frames kept falling. It only sticks if it's a long stripes across the frame, but even then some would fall. If you try to cut this into small strips to replace the command strips with the hook, it does not work. It sticks great to wooden things though. Not reliable overall.

Rating: 5, Review: I didn’t have the right screw to mount my speaker so I was trying to find something that would help stick to the mount.

I used it on plastic and metal! My speaker weighs about 10 pounds!

However, the next morning most of the stuff I had hung up were on the floor. Some items that had more generous amounts of tape stayed up, but only to fall during the second night. The single longest lasting item on the wall finally fell just before the 1 week mark. Nothing stayed on my walls with this product.

Rating: 5, Review: It works great but something to be aware of when I needed to adjust the item, it took the paint off the wall. Don’t tell my husband please 😂
Rating: 5, Review: I use this tape to secure pictures to the wall after leveling them ! It’s an excellent tape and easily comes off if needed. I would buy again.

Rating: 2, Review: This tape holds whatever on most any surface. Bought it for dorm room walls, not a good idea. See photos, it pulled so much of the wall off with the tape.
Rating: 3, Review: Worked well to hold down a rug we have in our bathroom but it didn’t work for me when I tried to use it to hold a 12x12 sheet on the wall. It came off after a few days

This will last longer than flowers indeed!! Worth it - get it if you love hummingbirds or just want to put a smile on someones face <3
Rating: 1, Review: I have purchased this type of card previously and have yet to be disappointed until now. My wife couldn't even tell it was supposed to be a butterfly bouquet, until looking very closely. The photo you see on your phone is close to actual size, maybe 4 inches high. Not spectacular nor engendering oohs and aahhs. I was actually embarrassed to give it. Notably the reviews are aggregate reviews for all the cards they sell, not just the one you purchased. So meaningless.  ***************************************  I neither received nor solicited recompense in any form for this review.

Rating: 5, Review: Bought them from my white board where I keep my daily schedule & todo lists !
Rating: 1, Review: These all came so vibrant and bright their first use, but when I went to use them a second time, every single color had dried up. I stored them right with their caps on tightly and tips down and they still dried out immediately.
Rating: 1, Review: I got these for a white board calendar to keep track of meds and daily issues for my cat with medical issues. I color code so the use of colors was important. It has been a little over a week and the blue and red have faded to be barely discernible. All the other colors came faded out upon opening.  It’s very disappointing. I thought expo was the brand for white boards but I’ve had cheap dollar store markers perform better than this. I will likely return and look for a different brand.
Rating: 5, Review: Love the colors except for the light green. It’s hard to see on dry erase board if you’re writing something out. It is too light.
Rating: 1, Review: The media could not be loaded. Does not work on acrylic boards

Rating: 5, Review: Well worth the purchase, my husband and I have white boards all over the house. And we use the Expo pens for all of our boards. They are easy to use and thin enough to write on our calendars and still be able to understand what the writing is. There very minimal smell if any. I love the color collection that comes with this set, each color has their own meaning on our calendars. It comes off the white board with ease.
Rating: 5, Review: I've had no issues with these over several years of use.
Rating: 3, Review: The product was hard to remove (in the darker colors) from my white board. This may only be MY white board. Don't know, but it is rather stubborn - still haven't gotten rid of the dark smudges.

Rating: 5, Review: These markers live up to the Expo name.
Rating: 2, Review: I only use the black as it is the only one that shows up on my clear dry erase calender. I was hoping these would work well since I need the smallest marker option available on my tiny calendar spaces. I also had a difficult time erasing it once or twice. Not the best!

Rating: 5, Review: I have printed thousands of pages on this paper over the past 5 years, and I will never buy another brand.

Rating: 2, Review: I ordered two reams which I'm using for printed brochures which when folded in half are 8.5"" x 11"" in size. The first ream had no problems. As I began folding sheets from the second ream I started having extremely frustrating issues with the creases. After lining up the width edges and folding down the crease I would experience drastic warping, crinkling, and bunching. After testing a few blank sheets it's become clear to me that the bottom (length) edges do line up, but reveal a massive cutting error from the manufacturing process. 2 stars because one ream was delivered as advertised

The lights are bright, and shine on the flowers almost like a spotlight. The problem I had was the cover version of the song was a little cheesy and bad, but my best friend isn't as critical about that kind of thing as I am, so I knew she would love the card.

Rating: 5, Review: The Pilot G2 took about a day to for me to get used to after using ballpoint pens and pencils for over 65 years. There were inkwells built into the desks in grade school. Times have changed…  What I discovered: It feels great in my large hand with comfortable grip, It puts down the ink so that I can easily read it, There is no smudging and no bleed through the paper, I don’t need to apply any pressure to get excellent results. These pens are relatively inexpensive, and I tested each single pen to verify that they were working perfectly. No negatives, and 5 Stars!  So, I’m a convert to the gel community!

Rating: 5, Review: I love the fact that I can buy 18 Stamps instead of 100. I don't use stamps very often, so these 18 stamps will probably last me a year. *ONE CAVEAT* When you order stamps make sure you get the 'Forever Stamps'. Amazon has stamps for less money,,,because they are .39 stamps, and they have other denominations as well.

Rating: 2, Review: I feel like when you pay 14 dollars for something it should be the colors it is supposed to be! Some of them are okay but even black is like grey!
Rating: 3, Review: I am sure these markers would be fantastic on a white dry erase board unfortunately unfortunately mine is clear and these do not show up very well.
Rating: 1, Review: Like other customers who bought the same set around the same time period, most of the markers had dried out before I even opened the package. The caps were not very tight on most of them, which probably explains why they dried out in the packaging. I will not waste any more money on this brand.

Rating: 5, Review: I smell nothing at all when I use these on a whiteboard. The color isn’t dim, it’s very much there. Can go thick or thin with versatile tip. Almost all the colors are easy to read. Other than keeping the package they came in, there isn’t a great way to store these. They’re NOT magnetic.

Rating: 5, Review: We have had this shredder for about a month and so far it works great. The other $15 one I bought more than 10 years ago and finally died (probably my fault). What I like about this one is you know the level of shredded paper so it’s obvious when to empty.
Rating: 5, Review: This shredder is great. You can put a few pieces of paper in this shredder, and it doesn't bog down.
Rating: 1, Review: Worked fantastic the first time I used it. Didn’t overwork it, no paper jams, no issues at all. Never worked again. Return was easy.

Long story short I am never buying an amazon brand ever again.

And if someone ""borrows"" my pen I watch them like a hawk till the give it back. Everyone at work now knows whose pens these are and NO ONE messes with them. I'm that possessive! Great pen!!
Rating: 5, Review: I had barrowed a pen from my manger and loved how it wrote and found this pen that looked just like the one she had. And I’m very please with these pens they write smoothly have a velvety feel and have a satisfying click sound! Love the set beautiful colors too
Rating: 3, Review: Love the colors. Feel sturdy. Smooth writing. BUT they skip when I’m writing sometimes. Not a huge deal but when I was using it at work on time sensitive papers. A little bit annoying. So these stay at home now.
Rating: 3, Review: I loved this pen set for how nicely it attaches to my pockets using the rolling ball clip, it was great to write with.....but.....it took right around a month for me to go through all 5 pens. This just isn't worth it I'm sorry to say. I hope more companies utilize the roller ball for the clip, but I can't justify purchasing this again sadly.
Rating: 4, Review: These pens work well and are very comfortable to write/draw with. There is a problem with them however, which is that when stored with the pen tip facing down vertically, the ink will start to leak out from the reservoir. This can unfortunately stain and ruin your pretty looking pens. This is probably a universal problem with pens, but I'm not an expert on such things.
Rating: 5, Review: I got these as a gift for someone, and they loved it! They seemed to write easy, had great design, and overall looked super fun!
Rating: 5, Review: Best pen for nurses. Almost every one on my unit has ordered these. Love them, they glide perfectly on the paper.
Rating: 5, Review: love that you get two identical sets of 5 pens when you order. one set of 5 pens has lasted me a semester, they have pretty much all dried out now. idk if you would consider that good or bad but i love the look and the way it writes as well as the grip, it has a soft feel and the colors are really cute so to me its good bang for your buck for two sets of pens that will last you a whole academic year.

Rating: 5, Review: One of the nurses in our OR brought in these pens and loved it. Now all the lady’s have them they spread like wild fire. If your a pen snob you must try this one, but keep your eyes on it because that pen snatcher… you know the one will have it in their pocket soon as they use it.
Rating: 1, Review: I returned this product. After just using it for 10 seconds, my hands hurt! I have small hands, and the pen was just a little too big and gave me hand cramps. I could not keep writing with it. However, the pen did write very nicely, but it is not ergonomic.

Rating: 5, Review: I love these pens. The ink is so smooth with no smearing. The color is just right
Rating: 5, Review: The pen fits nicely in your hand. Pen point rolls nicely over paper, no smudging. I was looking for a decent everyday pen at a reasonable price.
Rating: 5, Review: Amazing for gel pen users, looking for a precise tip and ease of use.
Rating: 5, Review: As a pen lover, these pens are great! Smooth writing, easy to hold on to, and pretty colors of the pens. The only issue I have is the smearing. You need to let the ink sit for a few seconds before closing a book, or running your hand over it. So to be a quick writer you should be mindful of where your hand is. Other than that they are fantastic pens!

Also, the package has adjustable clear plastic tabs and removable paper inserts for labeling which makes life easier and organize for us.
Rating: 3, Review: After I unpacked it and did a test fit in the file drawer itself, it was going to be to too long to fit. Even with taking off the adjustment parts, it would still not be able to fit. So I returned it, should have checked the measurements when I ordered it.

Rating: 4, Review: The notebook is smaller than anything I have ever used before. I prefer a larger notebook, but it serves the purpose of being more compact and portable than a 8.5x11 inch notebook. It seems to be sturdy. I’ll still use it, but in a more limited capacity than a larger wide-lined notebook. If you’re regularly going mobile, then this may be the best option.
Rating: 2, Review: The journal is of great quality, but I'm beyond bummed about the color. I was so excited to receive my new MINT colored journal, but what I got is more of a dark seafoam blue...  Completely ruined my excitement for it, but I'll get over it.  Skip the mint color option.

Rating: 4, Review: I've gotten these in different colors repeat purchase.
Rating: 5, Review: Brought for myself, lovely green color, comes in many vibrant colors, git the lined, pretty good book for the price. A tiny bit small (if you want a large notebook, this isn't that) but works well for me. Good amount of pages, pretty sturdy, would recommend.

Rating: 5, Review: I’ve used this as a diary/collection of memories and it’s held up really well. I’ve been using it since February. It holds pen and highlights well and doesn’t rip when I reposition my pictures. I enjoy writing in it!
Rating: 5, Review: Personal journal has so many little extra feature that set I apart from any journal I have ever had. Wish it had a pen holder!
Rating: 5, Review: Good page rulings, the ribbon marker is nice, the title page is very useful and the pocket in the back cover is too.

Rating: 5, Review: y’all, the paper is SO THICK!! none of my gel pens, markers, or rollerballs bleed through and there’s BARELY any shadowing. the book lays flat when you write, the colors are cute, quality craftsmanship. this is straight up better than every big name brand journal i’ve owned for basically a third of the price. i can’t see myself ever buying anything else ever again.  something to note; there’s no table of contents & the pages aren’t numbered. i personally prefer it that way but for the bujo lovers out there, it may be a con.
Rating: 5, Review: I really enjoy these notebooks, I use them daily at work, very nice to be able to jot down notes and thoughts during the day. I really like the elastic band
Rating: 5, Review: I was pleasantly surprised by the quality of this journal. I usually prefer the m-skin brand and i would say this one surpasses. The pages are smooth and secure, the pocket is roomy, and the price is more reasonable. I will buy these from now on.
Rating: 5, Review: Exactly as described. Good quality and love the colors.
Rating: 5, Review: I've been using Moleskins for over a decade... this product is just as good for a fraction of the price. Thank you very much. John Doolittle
Rating: 5, Review: The notebook was exactly as pictured. Perfect for my needs
Rating: 5, Review: I love these little journals! I was given one as a gift and have purchased two more since. I was looking for something of similar quality to a Moleskin at a lower cost. I use them for notes and to do lists at work and they're perfect - the paper is thick enough that pens don't bleed through, the covers are sturdy for drops and dings, and the elastic band keeps everything closed. The blank pages are helpful for more free notetaking. 10/10 recommend!

Rating: 5, Review: I love love love these pens. I have loved these pens since I was in high school!! I've bought countless packages over time and I have never ONCE been disappointed. The quality is always on point (no pun intended) and the thickness of the pen itself is exactly what I like.  So obsessed, and I always will be! I need more!
Rating: 5, Review: Easy to use bright colors that don’t bleed! No smell or smearing
Rating: 1, Review: Several of the pens on this pack came dried out and two of them drained ink all over the package before even opening it.
Rating: 5, Review: As I walk around the classroom while students work, I mark correct answers with my initials, which helps streamline my future grading. The students appreciate immediate feedback on their correct responses. My approach is to affirm what they've done right without interrupting their thought process. I mark the correct parts and move on without giving hints about errors. This method not only boosts their confidence but also encourages them to recognize and apply successful strategies to the problems they are solving or revising. The pens are vibrant, and cute. I love using them and will even doodle little pictures on their work while grading. The assortment of colors rock. Had them a whole semester and only one is starting to dry up as I use it so much.

Great value
Rating: 1, Review: Awful just awful. I have no idea what I was thinking buying off brand Post-its. My fault. If you want a frustrating experience and a realization that at whatever age you are you still do dumb decisions then buy this. Otherwise stick to the tried and proven.  Garbage
Rating: 1, Review: They do not have any “sticky” Not worth the price.
Rating: 3, Review: The Bright Colors Sticky Notes in 3x3 inches are a handy addition to any home or office for jotting down quick notes. Each pad contains 82 sheets, making them perfect for frequent use.  One of the standout features of these sticky notes is their vibrant colors, which add a pop of brightness to your workspace. The 3x3 inch size provides enough space for writing short messages or reminders.  While the adhesion of these sticky notes isn't the strongest, they still serve their purpose well for sticking to surfaces temporarily. They're easy to post on walls, notebooks, or desks, making them convenient for capturing ideas or to-dos on the go.  The self-stick pads are easy to peel off and reposition as needed, allowing for flexibility in organizing your notes. Despite the moderate adhesion, they stay in place for general use and don't leave residue behind when removed.  Overall, the Bright Colors Sticky Notes are ideal for quick notes and reminders in home, office, or school settings. Their bright colors and easy-to-use design make them a practical choice for anyone looking for sticky notes that are both functional and visually appealing.

Rating: 5, Review: My tween loves these! She uses them for her school projects.
Rating: 5, Review: Perfect for a great price!
Rating: 1, Review: These notes did not stay stuck together on the pad whatsoever. Used one batch and threw away the rest.
Rating: 3, Review: These are good if you are needing to just jot something down quickly. However they aren’t very sticky so they don’t stay put. Probably wouldn’t buy again.
Rating: 1, Review: The media could not be loaded. We received order with post its discolored and adhesive was dysfunctional like they were super old . Return center is too far from home and not worth the drive to process for refund
Rating: 1, Review: Adhesive dries out over time. I threw them out and bought the 3m post its.
Rating: 1, Review: I won't ever buy them again. I have to add a piece of tape so they don't fall off; not what you want from sticky notes.
Rating: 1, Review: Glue is not sticky
Rating: 1, Review: Doesnt stick - Adhesive is very bad
Rating: 5, Review: Worked well 👍
Rating: 1, Review: You get what you pay for. The colors are nice and they make OK pieces of scrap paper (vs using back of an envelope). However the adhesive is so weak, on a smooth surface it barely sticks. And on anything slightly textured, they fall off with the slightly movement (e.g. on a fridge door). Pay a little extra and get the pale yellow name brand (as many others have said here. I’ll just keep one or two of them and out the rest into the recycle bin.
Rating: 2, Review: I like the variety and colors, but the stickies aren’t even that sticky. The sheets were falling apart from each other just holding it.

Rating: 5, Review: Colors are nice and they work exactly the same as the name brand…would definitely order again but these will last a long time 👍🏻
Rating: 1, Review: These are awful! There is absolutely nothing sticky about these notes. right out the package these would not stick to anything. If you are looking for sticky notes these are not it
Rating: 1, Review: Glue is not tacky enough and notes fail quickly. (Even if you follow the special instructions included in the packaging for removing the notes - which - if you think about it - if they have to include special procedures to make something as simple and straight forward as a sticky note work as expected... there might be an issue)  Spend the extra on the real things.
Rating: 2, Review: I can not believe these positive reviews for these mediocre sticky notes. I can't remember the last time I bought something so highly rated and was this disappointed.  I have sticky notes all over my desk because the adhesive is so bad that the pad doesn't even stay together. Whenever I try to post a note on something, I have to use tape to hold it up, which defeats their purpose.  If you want colorful square pieces of paper, this is for you. If you want them to stick to things, I highly recommend you look elsewhere.
Rating: 1, Review: Joining the ""these don't stick""chorus. If you want pretty colored notepads, go for it. If you want functional sticky notes that will stick for more than a handful of seconds, look elsewhere.
Rating: 1, Review: The notes barely stick to anything, and the paper itself, is almost one-ply toilet paper thin.
Rating: 1, Review: When the sticky notes don't even stick to eachother, that's a problem. Will be returning them.
Rating: 2, Review: Sticky Notes that don't stick??? Really??? I threw them into the trash and bought POST IT notes.

Sending my 3 book copies to library of Congress for copyright. Love it.
Rating: 5, Review: When you're working from home, it is so easy to run out of ink in your printer. I did go to my local store and they were out. I found this ink for my printer and it was less expensive than my local store. It arrived in no time and I was able to continue on working with no interruptions. I have ordered this several times and will continue to order this in the future.
Rating: 3, Review: Can't tell you why but the printer showed the cartridge to be 1/2 full but there was no ink on the paper. I reinstalled it & still no ink so I replaced the cartridge and the new one worked fine but....given the cost, it's mind numbing that I had to throw it out when it was supposedly still 1/2 full of ink. No problem with any other cartridge henceforth.

Rating: 5, Review: I've ordered this twice, and both times my order arrived earlier than expected. The cartridges worked perfectly in my printer and the print quality is good. The only thing I was disappointed with is that I found that these ink cartridges don't last as long as the other ones I used previously. I used to use off brand inks, but HP is now making you use HP cartridges or you can't print. I don't print much, but these only last about two months. But at least they are inexpensive since I'll be needing to buy more throughout the year than I used to.

I only got 61 printed pages from this cartridge and got stuck in a bad spot on a time sensitive project. Will not buy this particular cartridge type again. I was printing forms. No logos with heavy color saturation that would have consumed extra ink.
Rating: 1, Review: HP is a joke and is going through a class action lawsuit about bricking printers that use 3rd party ink, so they upcharge on their propriety ink...
Rating: 1, Review: I purchased this several months ago and didn’t need to install it until last night. A friend of mine, an IT expert, tried repeatedly to get this thing going in my brand, new printer, and the printer kept saying that something was wrong with the cartridge. When I contacted Amazon for a refund, they told me I had to talk to HP, they sent me a link to HP that basically doesn’t even work to get hold of Customer Service. I’m disgusted and offended and I will not be buying any more ink from Amazon.
Rating: 5, Review: Actual HP print cartridge. So worth it. No spills, no incompatible errors on the printer and they last a long time.

After receiving them they most certainly do not.
Rating: 5, Review: Performance and quality
Rating: 5, Review: Nice quality, color and size. The tabs are spaced nicely and the folders perform as expected.
Rating: 5, Review: The file folders are the typical size and thickness. I got them on sale so it was a good deal.
Rating: 5, Review: Great value for the money. Very well made.
Rating: 5, Review: Good quality and the right amount. These are standard size and made of good quality paper. Having offset tabs was a requirement for me and these worked out great.
Rating: 5, Review: Nice folders good weight hold everything that I need.
Rating: 5, Review: This product is used to store files and to keep materials in an orderly state. It does what it is intended to do at a nice price point!
Rating: 4, Review: It's nice to buy some relatively sturdy and reliable 1/3 cut file folders. The brand name version costs more, basically for the name, which isn't worth its higher prices.
Rating: 5, Review: Designed for filing
Rating: 5, Review: I have many kinds of papers to put into category. This folder is light and cheap, perfect to put all my papers in place. Like it and will purchase again!
Rating: 4, Review: These Manila folders are great, the only reason for the 4 stars is because they don’t have a box to store them in. They came in the Amazon shipping box, which is a bit bulky to store them in. But aside from that, the product itself is great.

Rating: 4, Review: Cheap, but a bit flimsy and tabs are not varied
Rating: 3, Review: Folders are too thin for my files. Tore easily. Needed more durable folders
Rating: 5, Review: The price was right, they are typical office files, three tab, a tad bit flimsy (but I think they all are these days, no matter where you buy them) correct size and color.
Rating: 5, Review: A necessity in my line of work (and my OCD) - functional, durable, and reasonably priced!

Rating: 5, Review: thx
Rating: 1, Review: I'm going with EPSON after my IT guy mentioned that HP has chronic problems. Problems with their printers and problems with their ink. AND NO RETURNS
Rating: 1, Review: I put the blue (cyan) cartridge in my printer and it is defective. It was a package of all three colors and now I need to go out and get a blue cartridge so that my printer will work
Rating: 5, Review: I like that it’s not a hassle for me to install the ink cartridge and run a test print before use. This cartridge printed immediately after installation. So far, so good. I’m hoping drying time seems normal.
Rating: 1, Review: HP ink isn't cheap. I was very disappointed that the Cyan ran out after only two pages of printing. This meant my print was pink, which was not acceptable and this of course used the other colors.
Rating: 5, Review: Printer cartridges are getting pricier, and the design of my HP printer can only accommodate the smaller, narrower refills (except the black cartridge). If you print very frequently, consider a DOUBLE order on the 3 color cartridges. 😉
Rating: 1, Review: One doesn't work, I'm mad.
Rating: 1, Review: The ink cartridge came with no plastic around it. The orange thing was in the box but not attached. I got black ink all over my hands and inside the box it came it. Usually these cartons with protective plastic around them. The colored ones I order with it arrived sealed.

I haven't found an alternative so I continue to use them, unfortunately.
Rating: 3, Review: This HP cartridge stopped printing well after a few weeks. Faint print, lines cut off, apparently misaligned. Re-aligning didn't work, because the quality of the printed scan/align page wasn't good enough for the scan to properly align. Of course, this happened after the return window closed. Called HP support, after about 3 hours of testing, re-installing, and wasting a lot of paper, the agent offered to send me a replacement. The new cartridge works well so far, so fingers crossed. I'd give HP support 5 for their help and free replacement (out of warrantly), a 1 or 2 to the seller for a faulty cartridge, but I'll up it to 3 because past purchases have worked fine. Of course, like other users have noted, this isn't a cheap solution, and I suspect HP's ""cartridge verification"" is actually part of the problem when cartridges don't measure up.
Rating: 1, Review: Printer will not work with this faulty ink. Tried to return it HP refused.

Rating: 5, Review: I usually have to run an ink/print test after installation, but with this set I didn’t have to. It just printed my documents without any problems.

Rating: 1, Review: This product was sealed in an undamaged box and undamaged interior packaging. When I opened the orange tab, ink poured out of the cartridge. Ruined my clothes, hands, and floor! Unbelievable! You spend extra for the true HP ink and half of it spills out.

Rating: 5, Review: Only use black. Didn’t get 100-pages of type out of the cartridge
Rating: 1, Review: I have two cartridges, and neither are accepted by the printer. I suspect because they say they’re from Malaysia? I need replacements that work on this printer.
Rating: 5, Review: Not as cost effective and refills and knock-offs but works well and consistent printing.
Rating: 1, Review: This was the third time ordering this product color along with Magenta. HP printer gave notice that the cartridge was probably fraudulent, almost empty and did not recognize it as an HP cartridge. Magenta 910XL was nearly depleted after being installed. This was purchased in advance of when it was needed, so the 30 day return did not apply.
Rating: 1, Review: I bought XL HP cartages and turns out that my office jet will not allow me to printing with them, so I ended getting HP cartages. This cartage in particular worked once out of 20 prints and it was only for two inches of paper. Apparently you can't win.

The design is beautiful and looks exactly like the photo but even more special in person. Even the envelope is great quality paper! I love. Will definitely be buying more from this seller
Rating: 3, Review: First off... I do not understand the ""I""??? on the front. Had I noticed that I don't think I would have gotten it. I just don't even understand what it is supposed to mean? It's bizarre. Next, for an $14 card I expected it to be at minimum double the size. (I've gotten other pop up cards for cheaper that are much larger.) If I hadn't misplaced the other one I ordered, and didn't need to get it in the mail today, I would have returned it for a different one. It's still pretty, and mom will love it, which is the main thing!

Rating: 5, Review: My Mother is 103 yrs old and has dementia. Pictures are still ""enjoyable"" to her. I tell her about every person in our family and she always ends our visit with, ""I really liked your stories."" So each year it is harder to find a card that will be noticeable and comforting. This card opens up to a lovely pop up which can be kept open on her dresser and enjoyed. I wish I had found this card when she knew who I was, but a smile on her face is enough. The price is higher but the the joy and love it brings to any Mom is well worth it.

Rating: 5, Review: I don't know why we waited so long to buy fresh, sharp scissors. We had pairs of old rusty ones that seemed ""good enough."" I suppose trying to be thrifty in a time of high inflation made buying new scissors seem to my immigrant-mindset like the gateway to a mentality of extravagance. I'm happy with this purchase decision.

Rating: 5, Review: I love these scissors. They cut well
Rating: 5, Review: worth the money
Rating: 5, Review: Great value for good good quality scissors.
Rating: 5, Review: These are fantastic scissors and are great for cutting through cardboard, paper, wire, thread, wrapping paper and anything else we've challenged these scissors with. Why are we buying more you say? Because the one thing these scissors can't do, is self locate. We have three kids and 6 pairs of scissors. I keep giving them the old crappy ones that don't cut very well but they don't like those so every time I reach over in my office or the kitchen for the good scissors they aren't there and when I grill, excuse me, question the kids gently, they each angelically reply, ""It wasn't me mom."" So they get the old ones and I'll try and hide these better until I forget and they make off with these again and I will be back here ordering more. If anybody sees the missing socks and scissors that have gone permanently missing from our house, please let me know. I might be able to fund one of their college educations or at least summer camp.
Rating: 5, Review: see headline
Rating: 5, Review: These are a good quality set of scissors. I had bought some in the past but had to replace the old ones. They were used for other purposes than a scissors and ruined the cutting edge. A family member used this to cut heavy wire and ended up scoring the cutting edge (for that, he should have used the wire cutter but grabbed whatever was closest at the time). Works well with paper, cloth, thread, cardboard box, styrofoam, plastic, and so on. These are easy to clean and do not rust after running through the dishwasher. They are lightweight.

Price is less then in stores. Will buy again
Rating: 5, Review: I've used this tape in several moves and also on boxes that have been in storage for years. Very durable.
Rating: 5, Review: Seems to do what’s expected of shipping tape. No issues
Rating: 1, Review: Two rolls in the 6-pack were missing a half of the tape, while still being ""sealed"" by the plastic wrap. This is a low level scam attempt. Requested a refund, sent this ridiculous package back.
Rating: 5, Review: This tape worked very well. We taped up a whole box with it. The dispenser and tape arrived right on time. Thank you for such a prompt shipment.
Rating: 5, Review: We buy a six-pack a year to use while packaging boxes. Great value for the money. Totally worth it to get the heavy duty tape over cheap, thin stuff.
Rating: 5, Review: Wish I would have ordered these prior rather than buy at CVS with 40% discount. Will be back!
Rating: 2, Review: This tape doesn't apply to the boxes very well. I used all the rolls to see if the quality would changed but all the rolls were consistently not adhesive. We instead got this after using up the rolls, even though getting individual cutter seemed wasteful, and these are much better.  https://www.amazon.com/dp/B000J07BRQ?psc=1&ref=ppx_yo2ov_dt_b_product_details
Rating: 5, Review: I've tried some of the cheaper tape in my ecommerce company, but keep coming back to this tried and true.
Rating: 5, Review: Scotch brand shipping tape is one of the best (if not the actual best) clear shipping tapes on the market. It’s great for sealing cardboard boxes and poly bags. I also use it as a protective layer over my inkjet labels so rain doesn’t smudge the address. No complaints, 5 stars!

Rating: 1, Review: The tape was cheap and thin, not good at all. Don’t buy it. We ordered it because it was advertised as heavy duty!!
Rating: 5, Review: This tape is excellent. We’ve used it for taping boxes during a few moves - held up perfectly even those heavy kitchen boxes! We also use this for shipping - taping boxes/paper. Excellent. Definitely worth the extra money!
Rating: 5, Review: Be careful what you let this touch because it's going to stick. I realize that is what tape is for and this stuff does it's job. I was telling my bartender about this stuff and he said, ""IT'S TAPE!!! GET OVER IT AND ORDER A DRINK!"" I ordered a Scotch.....
Rating: 5, Review: Always love the brand name. So dependable. Never trust an off brand
Rating: 5, Review: If you are moving, this is truly an excellent tape! The only thing better would be tape with threads in it, but that's a bit pricey.
Rating: 5, Review: I moved and used this packing tape for everything. None of the boxes came open during the move. I did use a tape wheel device with them, but the tape was easy to use and apply as well. Good quality.
Rating: 5, Review: I had been using a cheaper brand of tape previously and just wouldn’t stick to the cardboard adequately, so I purchased the 3 M tape that holds the joints together nicely.

Rating: 5, Review: 3M is not the cheapest but it is the best value and usually simply the best, period! Kinda hard to go wrong. This clear packing tape is strong and the adhesive holds even when wet.
Rating: 4, Review: This is the best packing tape I've found. It's very sturdy and has good sticking power. I ship packages out multiple times a week and this tape is very reliable and secure. My only complaint is that it is very hard to get the roll started and if you mess up and it splits, it's hard to recover from. I just wish 3M would make these rolls easier to get started.

Rating: 4, Review: This is a pretty card. It's larger than I expected. I have bought other brands where the flowers are so realistic looking that it's like they're real flowers. These are pretty but don't look ""real"". But it's also cheaper than other brands I've seen. So, there's the trade off. Still a nice card.

Rating: 1, Review: I have used ""Sharpie"" brand products for most of my 75 years, and have found them to be robust and excellent quality. Sadly, this package did NOT live up to my expectations, the included assorted tips were far drier and less-robust than I have encountered previously. I would skip purchasing this one.

Rating: 2, Review: Very poor quality. Difficult to separate through perforated line
Rating: 1, Review: Got this for my business and every sheet I tried to tear is uneven. Horrible.
Rating: 1, Review: I dislike that the so called 12” ease of use perforation does not tear off cleanly! This will be the 2nd time I’ve had to return and replace this item.
Rating: 4, Review: Small-ish bubbles, but decent size roll. Used for a cross country move and don’t recall anything breaking. Only complaint is that the tear off pieces weren’t serrated enough so it would just end up ripping funky. I used scissors and cut the pieces. Fine, but just made things take longer.
Rating: 5, Review: It's great bubble wrap and a good price
Rating: 3, Review: When I try to tear off a small piece to use in a special small size for household taping needs it is difficult. I use my hand and fingers for small project so the dispenser can not be used like when taping boxes. The tape sticks to finger and when you try to pull off to position on item, it sticks to my finger so much it tears when I pull. Gorilla Tape does not do this. Also if the tape accidently sticks to the roll, then my finding the edge so I can pull to get it going again, it will cause a rip down the length of the roll. A short way of saying it would be, it is difficult to work with.
Rating: 5, Review: Nice big size and great perforations easy to use and size for different packages!
Rating: 3, Review: Perforation tears poor.
Rating: 1, Review: Terrible product. Very hard to tear wasted a lot of it. Can barely see the perforated line. Put a dye on perforated line

Rating: 1, Review: Spent more time trying to locate the perforations than needed!! More times than not it then ripped wrong!
Rating: 2, Review: This does not rip into pieces well. Bought the wrong brand and would not rip into sections.
Rating: 2, Review: The wrap itself is fine but the perforation is terrible. It does not tear consistently.
Rating: 5, Review: This is well worth the money.
Rating: 3, Review: Using bubble wrap to pack for moving and perforations are hard to find. Ended up just tearing off the amount I needed to wrap my items. Would not recommend if want easy tear off sheets and will not buy this product again.
Rating: 1, Review: The “perforations” were terrible. Didn’t tear along the lines. Wasted so much extra. Bought this 2 years ago and it was fine, this round was awful.
Rating: 3, Review: Be careful how you tear it it don't tear clean :/
Rating: 5, Review: Great for shipping items and perforated to tear off easily.
Rating: 3, Review: Good quality. But it is sooo frustrating that it doesn’t tear where it is supposed to. It just rips across, sideways, any direction. I’ve bought plenty of this from other sources and have never had such a frustrating experience. I’ll never buy from this company again.
Rating: 1, Review: I am not going to buy this again. Perforations for the most part are non-existent. Where there are perforations, here and there, they do not work, you can't rip the sheet of bubble wrap cleanly. I sell and ship fragile items for a living, I don't have time to sit here cutting bubble wrap with scissors. I recommend you don't buy this product.
Rating: 5, Review: Lots of quality bubble wrap at a reasonable price. Made my move a lot easier.
Rating: 2, Review: This is the fourth and last time buying this bubble wrap as with the past three rolls, I have had to cut every individual piece with scissors. You could purchase a cheaper product with better quality.

Rating: 5, Review: Works great!
Rating: 5, Review: A generous supply. Worked beautifully to cushion my fragile stuff for mailing.
Rating: 1, Review: I bought a previous off the wall no name bubble wrap with fragile stickers, pretty much the same price. I needed another but was gonna take too long of a wait to get it. So I ordered something different. I chose Duck cause if the name brand and the size was what i was loooking for. I'd say hands down the no brand WINS against name brand ""Duck"". Duck was thin, couldn't find the perfs and when you did they didn't tear. I'd NEVER buy this product again. If I could give it big fat zero I would.
Rating: 3, Review: Price is good, cushioning is good but the perforations do not tear well and I end up using scissors to cut instead. Not sure I will buy again.

Rating: 4, Review: These do not seem to adhere as well as my old laminating pouches - have used GBC and Duck. Usually need to run through laminator twice - hardly ever had to do this with old pouches. Material being laminated does not seem to affect adherence. Have not used a lot of these so the final verdict is still out but so far a little disappointing.

Rating: 1, Review: I was very excited to try this product. As a schoolteacher, I am constantly laminating things. However, when I went to use it, it jammed my machine. I asked a fellow teacher to use her machine. And these sheets jammed her machine as well. I wanted to return them, but I didn't use them right away, so I missed my return window opportunity.
Rating: 5, Review: Works fine
Rating: 4, Review: Update: After using a few more, it seems like just a few from the package were warping and the rest have been fine.  Compared to others, these sheets turn out wavy and with small pockets that do not fully seal. I will not be purchasing them again.
Rating: 5, Review: Amazing price for the amount !!
Rating: 5, Review: I have purchased these multiple times to use with my small laminator. They are letter size and have a nice amount of margin if you are not wanting to cut the page. Even if you do cut apart the page after laminating, it does not peel off of what you laminated. I would recommend rounding the corners of what you cut, because your page will definitely be thicker and corners can be pokey if left as is. I just use a corner rounder punch if I am making task cards, etc...

Rating: 5, Review: Small, sturdy and works great
Rating: 1, Review: We don't laminate too many items, so still have 1/2 the box left after 6-7 years.  They weren't the best to start with, and by now they no longer work at all. Ran it through the laminator twice and was able to pull apart with no effort when cold.  So, don't buy more than you can use in a year or two!
Rating: 3, Review: The pros: The lamination sheets are so thick it's very fast and easy to insert pages into the sheets. Once laminated it's very thick. The cons: If you need to cut things within your laminated sheet, even just the edges to make it regular paper size, or if you wish to use a round edge cutter on your laminated pages, the lamimation tends to come apart. I did not have this issue with a thinner (3 mil) lamination paper that I used to use, which was also cheaper. It was harder to insert my pages into those sheets prior to laminating, however, the lamination stayed together very well and didn't come apart when rounding edges or cutting it. I will be going back to my cheaper brand. I laminate a ton, being a home school teacher and a primary aged children's leader at my church. I need something I can depend on, that will stay together when I cut it or when I round the edges so they're not sharp, and this doesn't meet that goal. It's too bad, because it is much easier to load with these sheets.

It appears this shipment is a replacement shipment. In this order the outside box was solid and closed on all sides. The paper itself had rips and tears and if the outside box wasn't well closed it might have been an issue. Overall I am happy now.

Rating: 5, Review: In my opinion, paper is paper. I bought the paper through Amazon because of the price, plus it was delivered to my front door. I no longer shop at Walmart. Walmart does not deliver to me because of my location. I do not care for Walmart. They are not the cheapest store anymore. I love Amazon. Remember this is my opinion. I can get anything I want from Amazon with no problems. I have never sent anything back to Amazon.

Rating: 4, Review: I love Ticonderoga pencils, I’m an elementary school teacher & they stand up very well to little hands. However the shipping & delivery was careless. Pencils arrived with open boxes (inside the Amazon bag) and pencils falling out.
Rating: 5, Review: Well made and durable.
Rating: 5, Review: What I like is that I use them for things on paper. I use this product for illustrations, writing, and others.
Rating: 5, Review: A favorite brand. Makes good lines when drawing. Easy to erase. Feels good in my hand. Sharpens to a nice point. Get a lot for the money.
Rating: 5, Review: Bought for elementary kids school supplies. These were recommended by school & teacher.
Rating: 3, Review: I've gotten these pencils before and they were great. I finally ran out and had to order more. These were very different. It's almost impossible to sharpen them to a sharp point. Which I prefer. The lead (graphite) fell out of the middle of the pencil on the first one I tried to sharpen. I have to resharpen every time I use them so they have a short life span. The only pluses I can think of so I could give them three stars is they're inexpensive and once you get them the way you want, they write well. The eraser is decent too.

The labels are small but it is super neat to connect to your phone and print labels.
Rating: 1, Review: I'm really disappointed with the print quality. I was excited to purchase this (and the M02), but every print is chunky/pixely and just overall low quality. I've followed their suggestions in the app to improve the print quality but it's still awful. I typically use my Cricut for labels, but I have some items that have variations, and it's a pain to set that up every time. I was hoping this would be a great alternative, but I was wrong. I'll probably keep using this one for now because it's easy, but I was hoping for more, considering some of the product images.
Rating: 5, Review: The media could not be loaded. I wanted something to easily print custom labels for miscellaneous items around our house. This little label maker is perfect for the job! I like that you can easily and quickly customize labels right off the app. Definitely beginner friendly and great for personal use! Small and easy to store or travel with. I’ve only had it a few months but we’ve had no issues yet.
Rating: 5, Review: Bought this to label stuff around the house. Still working on trying to learn how to use the several option in the app to make decorative labels. Take some learning to use the app.
Rating: 1, Review: When I first got this I was super excited it was easy to setup and use to create labels for my babies drawers. Then I went to use it a second time only a few days later and the label were printing blank. I tried to search how to fix it but there is not much on the web. Of course it was past the time for me to return it since I didn't open it right away. I am very disappointed as I got extra rolls and this was a complete waste of money.
Rating: 5, Review: Fabulous!!! So easy to use. Very helpful. Highly recommend. Great to give as gifts.
Rating: 5, Review: I bought this label maker for my kitchen. I often vacuum seal things such as meats for sous vide or coffee beans for freezing, and I've also used this for labeling squeeze bottles and other various things around. I cannot overstate how easy this is to use. The app connects to your device seamlessly, and you can very easily print out whatever design you want. Complete flexibility in your hands.  That being said, the ONE thing I can complain about here is you have to re-order labels from China. It took about 14 days for my new set of labels to get here, which wasn't a problem because I ordered them before I finished my first roll. So, be prepared and you're good.
Rating: 2, Review: Not as easy to use as they show in the videos. Can't change much either (font, centering, etc.) so half the label gets wasted. Will not purchase again.
Rating: 5, Review: Great and easy to use for your daily use. I have a very big brand printer that 5x the cost of this printer but this is my go to because of the easy of use and cost if cartridges of the more expensive machine more then this unit.
Rating: 5, Review: Easy to charge. Easy to download the app to get started. Easy to pair with your phone. Easy to print labels. Love it!
Rating: 2, Review: It seems like a good device to print labels from your phone. The claim that it's a great ""office label maker"", however, is blatant false advertising: you can't use it from a laptop/desktop machine, and every label needs to be painfully typed and designed using the awkward phone app. If your goal is to crank out a few dozen labels, or to integrate this into a desktop workflow, expect to spend literal hours and get very frustrated.
Rating: 5, Review: I bought it, used it once, threw it in a drawer, and forgot about it.  Two years later I need to print an FAA tag for a drone. By some miracle, I remember this things existence and find the exact spot I left it in.  I didn’t even need to charge it. It booted right up, I downloaded an app and typed in the license, print my label, stick it on my drone, and back in its crypt the label maker goes (likely for another 2 years).  I think it’s safe to say it’ll work then too. 5 stars.

Rating: 5, Review: This was exactly what I needed for labeling my items for craft shows. I put 2 prices on each sticker and cut them in half so they are smaller. The directions were super simple and the app was easy to use as well. I'm not a techy, so I was glad it was so easy. I fellow crafter suggested it and she was totally spot on.
Rating: 5, Review: This is a review of Phomemo D30 Label Maker Machine, in green. The ASIN (Amazon Standard Identification Number) is B08HV3MPFD. The printer comes with a roll of 80 14mm x 40mm white cut labels. The Print Master app connected quickly to the printer. Operating the machine is easy with the Lits Mode, but the Creation Mode offers more opportunities for personalized design. Choose the size of label. Then, let loose your creative vibes. Choose from a multitude of printing options. After using this pint sized printer, I can understand why it has over 17,000 positive reviews. I am very glad that I bought this printer.
Rating: 2, Review: This product was very difficult to operate, requiring two to three Q codes just to make it work. But, the tape feed has a mind of it's own, and never works consistently. I've included a photo of what it did overnight. I am sure it was turned off, and the app was closed. The programming on this product is bad, beware before you buy. Faulty.

Rating: 5, Review: Love these pens, write very smooth without smudging
Rating: 1, Review: I purchased these pens, with the thought this is a name brand! Upon arrival the pen would not write. YouTube video suggested place the cartridge in very hot water for several minutes. I did this several times, improved but not there, Sharpie suggested soak in alcohol this seemed to work. But for how long? My theory for these non working pens; Simply old stock sold to independent suppliers to Amazon.
Rating: 5, Review: As a busy professional who relies heavily on note-taking and document editing, I can confidently say that the SHARPIE S-Gel Gel Pens are an absolute game-changer. These pens have become an indispensable tool in my daily business operations, and I can't imagine using anything else.  From the moment I started using these gel pens, I was impressed by the smooth, effortless writing experience they provide. The 0.7mm medium point is perfect for my needs, offering a nice balance between precision and boldness. The ink flows seamlessly onto the paper, allowing for a consistent and clean line every time.  One of the standout features of these gel pens is the exceptional quality of the ink. The rich, black color is deeply pigmented, ensuring that my notes and markings are always clear and legible. Even after extended periods of use, the ink doesn't fade or smudge, maintaining its vibrant appearance.  In addition to their outstanding performance, these gel pens are incredibly durable. I've been using the same set for months, and they show no signs of wear or drying out. The caps fit snugly, preventing any accidental drying or leaking, which is a common issue with lesser pens.  Another aspect that I appreciate is the sleek and comfortable design of these pens. They fit perfectly in my hand, allowing for extended writing sessions without any fatigue or discomfort. The sturdy barrel and rubberized grip ensure a secure hold, preventing any slipping or cramping.  Overall, the SHARPIE S-Gel Gel Pens have exceeded my expectations in every way. They are the perfect tool for any professional setting, delivering exceptional performance, durability, and comfort. Whether you're taking notes in meetings, editing documents, or signing contracts, these gel pens will become your go-to choice. I highly recommend them to anyone seeking a reliable and high-quality writing instrument for their business needs.

Delivery logistics, outside temperatures in Minnesota, etc made real flowers a Plan B when I found this amazing card! I sent it direct from Amazon. No written words were necessary.  The butterflies connect us in a memory of a bouquet I made her with wildflowers fifty years or so ago. It was beautiful. I thought. I was probably four years old. My older sister and I had gathered a bouquet of truly amazing flowers fom the meadow. We added butterflies we caught on the road, drinking and cooling off after a rainstorm. Some were extracted from car radiators.

And I forgot to put the cap back on tightly after using one and the ink dried out quickly, I had to toss a couple because they dried up because of this so while they are fun they could be more durable.

Rating: 5, Review: Folder quality is good but shipping next day was great
Rating: 2, Review: This product is not for any files whoch would be used frequently. This is probably my error becasue I should have looked for a sturdy product. These files can work for simple sorting of data or for file notes but for info retrieval they are very disappointing. Would not buy this product again. I also do not believe the product brand because the three cut files are not cnsistent. I gacve to my little ones to play office.

Rating: 5, Review: Liked the product. Just what i needed
Rating: 3, Review: I don't have a lot of paper files. I went digital years ago and usally use clear poly files for the paper ones I have. Had a project that required manila folders and burned through the box I bought probably ten years ago so I ordered these for the few times I may need them. The quality has really gone down. They have significantly reduced the weight of the stock. Also rather than a smooth finish they now have a rough finish. If your use is to create a file that you may seldom have to look at these are probably OK. If your use is a file that you will actively use, you probably wan to look elsewhere though every company, to save costs. may have reduced quality as well.

So far I have not noticed that it provides any pain relief. It does have a very strong chemical odor.
Rating: 1, Review: Pad instantly went flat. No support whatsoever. I’m 200 lbs and thought I would at least get some support but I did not. Over priced for what it is. It’s just cheap memory foam
Rating: 3, Review: This thing isn’t worth 70 plus dollars, and it’s not plus size friendly. If you weigh over 200 SMOOSH it’s like nothing is even there. It should come with a weight limit for beneficial use.
Rating: 2, Review: It's very comfortable for a couple of hours, but not for all day at the office use. I got it mainly for sciatica pain relief. While this cushion advertises that it's made to help with sciatica, it doesn't accomplish that. At least not for me. Even after I get up and walk it off it just comes back not long after sitting again. Might be a great cushion for other issues, but not sciatica. Would not purchase again.
Rating: 2, Review: This cushion was not feasible for a 90-year-old woman we could not get her up on top of it it's so tall so I would not recommend anyone buying this for their grandmother or mother it's not even usable looking for something else
Rating: 5, Review: I was tempted by this seat cover when first looking for one because of the stellar reviews. However, I was off by the price, so I bought a competitor's product.  I bought an Amazon basics seat cover - hey, it was only $25! It's from Amazon, it must be built to at least acceptable standards, right? Wrong! The cutout for the coccyx is much too small, and the pad itself is small. I am not a particularly large man: 5' 8"", 160lbs. I could never get comfortable on it.  I bought another competitor's product, that one about $35, a wedge-shape specifically made for the car. It was great... for the first 2 weeks. That thing lost its shape incredibly fast; again, I only weigh 160lbs.  So I finally caved and bought this one. I didn't have high hopes - I had been burned twice before! But, man, this thing is different. The foam pad has very little give yet is comfortable and soft to sit on. I anticipate that it will last much longer than the others. It has generous space for your coccyx, I don't find myself constantly readjusting my position, trying to find the sweet spot.  Finally, the biggest benefit of this seat cushion that wasn't even on my radar: foam that comes around your bottom and slightly comes up your lower back. It's like you're sitting in a little bowl. This doesn't provide all that much support, however, *this is the magic touch that keeps you in the perfect position on the pad.* It just feels ""right"". I'm not constantly worried that I'll unconsciously shift in my seat and end up touching my spine to a bare wooden chair, causing immense pain. This thing holds me exactly where I need to be regardless of how much I fidget.  TLDR: This thing is 2x to 3x more expensive than competing products. However, competing products just don't measure up. Not only will you have to keep replacing those other seat cushions, you won't have a good time using them. I'm buying these seat cushions to relieve pain. This is the only one that does.
Rating: 5, Review: I use this for my driver’s seat of my car. Works well on the passenger side as well. Also good on wooden chairs and even folding sports chairs !!
Rating: 1, Review: Cushion flatens immediately so there is no support. Overpriced.
Rating: 4, Review: Works good with bad back
Rating: 1, Review: This advertisement was a lie, it said for sitting long hours which was a lie. I still hurt after an hour of sitting. Not worth the price.
Rating: 4, Review: I really enjoyed this cushion and also the lumbar version. I had a chair that I just couldn’t find a replacement and these were a great options. The lumbar is still supportive. I thought I would get more than 16 months out of the seat but it is flattening out. I weigh 175 lbs for reference.
Rating: 3, Review: I am a petite woman and the cushion is just too big for me. I have kept it and may gift it to a larger friend.
Rating: 5, Review: After my second spinal fusion on my lower back, driving and bumpy roads were causing considerable pain. This pad and a matching lumbar support cushion were perfect for smoothing out a bumpy ride.
Rating: 2, Review: Made back worse- bought 2 - waste of money. Too hard - didn’t relieve pressure.
Rating: 5, Review: It is good to use it while driving.
Rating: 4, Review: It is well made and does provide quite a bit of relief for back pain. Also comes with a Cover with a small zipper. Don't know how easy it would be to remove or to place back on seat cushion. Will update when removal and replacement take place. Stays in place when I get out of my desk chair, has grippers on bottom of cushion. So far I am happy with the product.
Rating: 5, Review: These are essential for me. I have three of them. One stays in my wheelchair, and I put it under me on the car seat when the wheelchair is traveling with me. A second one stays in the desk chair on the awning-covered outside terrace where I work at a computer when the weather is nice. A third one stays in my chair in the dining room. Have had them now for six months, and they have held up extremely well - my wife cleans them periodically and they look fine. I'm thinking about gettig a fourth cushion to use as a spare, but they are pretty pricey and I have been getting along so far with just the three. Highly recommend these if you have a painful tailbone/coccyx problem.

Rating: 5, Review: With me loosing 140 pounds I lost my butt. Yes, it is very bony now and hurts sitting down for long. I work sitting in front of a computer for 8 hours a day and it was miserable. I did my research and decided to give this cushion a try. It is very comfortable but wish it didn't move around as much in my chair. I would purchase this again.
Rating: 4, Review: I wasn't happy with the cushion because it is too high for me. While using the cushion my feet do not touch the floor. Makes my legs hurt after a while. For a taller person it might do fine!
Rating: 2, Review: I tried it, I did not think it was enough cushion. Seemed pretty flat. When I sat on it, I still felt the original chair I was sitting on. Not much support. I am kind of scared to see what the back support is going to feel like. I ordered both but o do not get that until Tuesday. Hopefully I don’t get ripped off twice. Time will tell.
Rating: 3, Review: It seemed to help with my tailbone pressure. Since my 2 week stay for open heart surgery my butt is sore from beds, chairs. I put cushion on a lift chair, with 10 pound restriction for 6 weeks it was my only choice. Maybe using cushion on a harder chair works better. The hole in cushion seems shallow as i have to reposition often Not busting their chops just my experiance
Rating: 5, Review: It’s better than anticipated.
Rating: 5, Review: I like the fact that this cushion does not slip and move around when sitting in stadium stands. Comfort is good too.
Rating: 5, Review: I bought this for my bed and chair bound husband. I had low expectations about how it would work in a leather recliner/lift chair, so I was pleasantly surprised at how comfortable it is and how well it works for him. He was in danger of developing pressure sores on his butt, but the cutout has ameliorated that. The foam is really superior, the cover soft jersey fabric and the base does not slip. Well worth the money.
Rating: 5, Review: good quality and comfort and support but does have strange odor on material

Unique card but overpriced. My complaint with this is there is no place on the large card to insert and hold the small card that you write your comments on. Therefore, it is just loose in the mailing envelope. I ended up taping the small card to the large one so it wouldn't be overlooked.

Rating: 4, Review: When you're paying for a card this price you want it to be pristine. This is my 5th purchase of these types of cards from this company. They are a huge hit. I'll keep buying them. However now this company puts a paper wrapping around the envelope and when you remove it the stickers pull some of the paper from the envelope off. It's quite obvious. So bc they're virtual signaling with, ironically, a paper product it has lessened the quality of the product. They should leave the wrapping off. Again, I'll still buy them but I find the new wrapping annoying.

Rating: 4, Review: These pens are AMAZING for myself and for a gift. The colors are great and they don’t bleed terribly. Unfortunately there will be random times where the pen just doesn’t work, or it will work on one type of paper/thickness of card stock and not work as well on others. Very strange but it won’t stop me from buying again!
Rating: 5, Review: These are hands down my favorite pens. I use a few of colors for my work calendar but I wanted all the colors just for myself! They write smooth, I've never had an issue with the ink running or getting stuck, and they last forever. They're fun to use and the variety of colors is perfect!
Rating: 5, Review: My teenage daughter uses these all the time and loves the variety of colors.
Rating: 3, Review: As for the pen, I wanted it to be medium to bold and they are fine line. Take it from me, I compared shopping around looking at the mm and the reviews. I compared it with the Bic brand the mm. What I have learned 0.7mm means different things to different companies, there is no standard. After reading numerous reviews that said medium, was not true. It writes like a fine line pen which makes it difficult for me to write with. First off it slows down my writing and my handwriting looks sloppy, therefore, I really, really, really have to write slow. It’s in the holding of the pen and the way the ink flows. It drives me crazy , but the colors are all not true, the orange and the pink, not a fan.
Rating: 5, Review: I'm a pen fanatic...
Rating: 3, Review: Most of these came dried out. Some worked fine for a week before I had to throw some out. It was weird. Some never even worked.
Rating: 5, Review: I like the way that these pens write, it's so hard to find a pen that you like, so when you do buy it up. I will be buying more.
Rating: 3, Review: These pens are great, smooth, and vibrant colors. My mistake was that I was looking for pens to mark in the bible during bible reading. Although they dry 3x faster for reduced smearing, they are not the best to mark bible pages because they tend to bleed through pages. So don't make the mistake I made, if you are looking for just colorful pens for art or to write they are the best, BUT if you are looking for pens to write on your bible pages they are not the one you need.
Rating: 1, Review: They write great initially with a lot of color options, but they dry up and stop working after maybe a week of use (still plenty of ink). Thought it was a fluke until it happened to my 5th color. Waste of money.

Rating: 5, Review: This seat cushion is extremely good quality and a great price. I bought two and will likely get more for other seats in my home. If you sit a lot at the computer this is great for support and comfort.
Rating: 3, Review: I am disappointed. I purchased the first of these seat cushions back in August of 2023....hubby has since taken over using that one, so I wanted to purchase another one for myself.  The new one just arrived and they LOOK identical on the outside, but the INSIDE is not the same.  The one from last year is comfortable, but it is also MUCH MORE DENSE AND SUPPORTIVE. The one that arrived today is much softer, and so it ""flattens"" and then the SUPPORT is not as good as the one we received last year.
Rating: 3, Review: Not big enough
Rating: 5, Review: provides relief.
Rating: 5, Review: I bout this seat cushion because i have low back and sits bone pain. It really help to relieve the pressure from sitting on hard surfaces.
Rating: 5, Review: I damaged my tailbone and it was so extremely painful to sit for more than a minute - My chiropracter suggested one of these cushions and I got this simply because it was available quickly. I had no idea what the quality would be like - I just wanted a cushion and now! I have used this cushion every single minute of the day since I bought it 5 months ago and it is still as comfortable as it was when I got it. If it starts to wear out or just not do its job properly, I will just buy another one - it is that good! I know it will be at least another year before I am able to sit without hurting so this will get plenty of use still. I literally carry it with me wherever I go - I may even look at buying more so I don't have to do that!

Rating: 3, Review: I have another cushion designed from another company that I prefer to the TushGuard Seat Cushion. I spend long hours in an office chair at the computer, and the TushGuard cushion goes flat early. My rear end and lower back start to hurt after about 30 minutes, and the cushion is simply uncomfortable to me. Instead of returning the seat cushion, I gifted it to a friend at work, and she absolutely loves it, so there you go. Maybe the TushGuard Seat Cushion will work for you. It just doesn't do it for me.
Rating: 3, Review: I had high hopes for this cushion to protect my tailbone. Unfortunately, the foam flattened down quickly, leaving my tailbone in contact with the hard seat. While the cushion looks nice and adds some softness to the chair, it didn't meet my expectations for comfort and support. If you're looking for a cushion to add a little padding, this might work, but it didn't provide the relief I needed.
Rating: 5, Review: I have a small sports car and the cushion gave me enough height to have better visibility.
Rating: 5, Review: I bought this pad with the hope it would enable me to use my riding mower again. What a relief! A total game changer. It also returned my enjoyment of driving my Miata. THANKYOU!!

As you can see, it is a pretty simple and basic stapler, they give you a decent chunk of replacements too. I'm sure it's fine if you just need to use it a few times a day. Would recommend it for the price!
Rating: 5, Review: works great light weight but staples good. well worth the price.
Rating: 5, Review: I needed an inexpensive extra stapler in my classroom. This one has worked perfectly so far. My students (6th graders), who can be rather inept when it comes to using office supplies, didn't destroy it on the first day of use! And they had to use it repeatedly to staple papers. After a thorough demonstration of what to do and not to do, about 100 students used it and it survived. That' a pretty impressive performance in a middle school.

Rating: 2, Review: The notebook itself is okay. The cover was scuffed and dirty when it arrived, like it had been tossed around before getting to me. The paper is thinner than I'm used to from Mead/Five Star, but it doesn't bleed terribly unless I linger in one place too long. All-in-all it's an affordable, functional notebook. If that's all you care about, this is probably the one.  But the QR codes. I hate the QR codes in the corners of the pages.  For those unaware, Five Star released a study app a few years ago, which you can use to scan your handwritten notes to be digitized for you. Within the app, you can organize them by subject, make digital flashcards, etc. Those QR codes in the corners of each page are so the app recognizes where the page is. The app won't scan in your notes if those QR codes aren't lined up in the brackets of the app's camera. Which means you can't use their app with any other notebooks or paper aside from Five Star.  So, they require you to use Five Star products to use their app, and every notebook you buy from them from now on will have an ugly little reminder in each corner of every page that says, ""HEY WE HAVE AN APP."" The QR codes are obvious, they're ugly, and honestly I find them a little distracting when I'm trying to take my notes.  If I wanted digital notes, I would take my notes directly into one of the literally hundreds of notetaking apps that don't require me to swear fealty to one brand of office supplies. There are also already apps which do essentially the exact same thing, but better (if the Five Star study app reviews are anything to judge by). And those apps don't mar my beautiful clean pages with hideous little boxes.  Every time I see those awful, hideous little digital squares, I'm reminded that Five Star is trying to strongarm its customer base into only ever using their products, and into using products we don't need or want. And maybe I'm overreacting a little bit, but I cannot stress enough how UGLY they are, printed in every corner on every page, taunting me.  I hate them and this will be the last Mead/Five Star product (and in fact, I will strive to ensure this is the last product from the entire ACCO company's family of brands) I buy until those awful QR codes go away.

Rating: 5, Review: thick and good quality
Rating: 5, Review: The spiral notebook is really solid. You can toss it into your backpack or floor and really not worry too much about the paper coming out or getting too mashed up in your backpack. The dividers are well made as well. You will need to prop it on your lap or a solid surface, but for me that wasn't an issue. Just thinking about using this when hiking, will need something to put it on for writing on it. The sheets are easy to turn from one to the other and easy to flip between dividers.

As I’ve used it, there are times the little thread of plastic doesn’t go all the way through the fabric and i have to retry a few times before it does.
Rating: 5, Review: Nothing is worse than putting an outfit on and findiing it isn't ""just right"". I've used this to quickly hem pants, put a little tack between buttons on a blouse, and tack up sleeves. Get one.

Rating: 1, Review: I tried this on several types of fabric to get it to work, but to no avail. Doesn’t work in the slightest. Super disappointing.
Rating: 5, Review: I ordered this over a year ago and never opened it. Being a busty woman, any button down shirt or dress is an issue. Yesterday, I used this for the first time. Unfortunately it didn't come with instructions and a QR code instead. If you don't catch that, they you look at the box for over 10 mins. Once you figure it you though, Its LIFE CHANGING. Taking less than 5 seconds, I had my dressed sealed up, with no issues. Hands down, would order this over and over and over again. The little ""tacks"" held in place all day
Rating: 2, Review: Terrible instructions. Only an example on Hijab stitching. Also, it only comes with one needle and uses hard plastic for stitching that itches when in contact with the skin.
Rating: 1, Review: I went online confident I could figure it out and make it work but after 30 minutes of you tube and Avery’s own very unhelpful website the thing came apart in my hands. Clearly others are having a different experience. I just wish i was one of them.

Rating: 1, Review: I read the instructions on the website, from the QR code, from Amazon, and even watched YouTube. This gun does not work. It is meant to ""tag"" two pieces of cloth together with a small piece of plastic. The needle is HUGE and will not go through two pieces of t-shirt fabric without a large amount of force. That being said, I bought TWO of these (one for me and one for my mom) and NEITHER of them worked. I spent literal hours trying to make it work, like I said I read all the directions, and no matter what it just poked a bunch of holes. I ended up returning both units because that's insanely expensive for something that does not work at all. There are a lot of other reviews that say the same, I should have read the 1 star reviews. Don't waste your money or time.

Rating: 1, Review: I only used this thing twice and on my third time using it, the needle popped off and now it’s totally useless. Now I have to throw it away. Not to mention it took me a half hour to find the needle so my toddler wouldn’t pick it up. Stay away from this product.

Rating: 5, Review: I absolutely love these! They wrote smooth and fine with ease. I honestly do not want to use any other pen!
Rating: 2, Review: That this pen was so adorable so I bought two for Easter gifts. I thought they would write really nice and was in the first few words they quit writing and you had to scratch around on the paper to get them going. Although that didn’t work well. Also as you use them, your hands annoyingly rub off the cute colors in Area. Super cute, but definitely not worth buying. Sorry to say that but it’s the truth.
Rating: 5, Review: These pens are the best, good grip smooth application but don’t use on transparent sticky notes. It will smear! Other than that I recommend these!
Rating: 1, Review: These pens did not write smoothly and was very choppy. Then two different times they bled onto my work scrubs. Do not recommend.
Rating: 5, Review: I love the weight of these pens and they write so well! I would buy again!
Rating: 5, Review: These pens are my new fave, the smooth matte barrel is so comfy & the ink writes like a pilot pen. There's a little rolling ball on the clip, that IDK what its there for but its fun to roll when youre in meetings pretending to take notes, HAHA. Ive gifted these to nurses, teachers, moms, dads, heck everyone! Highly recommend, it is amazing quality, esp for the price!! GO! Get it now!
Rating: 5, Review: Nothing makes a nurse happier than a really good ink pen. These are the smoothest I’ve ever used. The color choices are fantastic. Only down side is everyone will want to steal your pen so order extra.

Rating: 5, Review: Writes smoothly…it glides.., easy to hold, no slip, stylish yet simple. I shared them with my co workers and kids…they love how it writes. They too will order them.
Rating: 3, Review: These pens are cute but the ink isn't consistent and they make it very hard to write after just a few days of use
Rating: 4, Review: So many things to love about these pens... and only one that keeps it from being perfect. I love the barrel colors, looks like an expensive pen. I find myself rolling the little ball on the clip during calls aimlessly... the comfort of the pen is great when writing for an extended time. The overall quality of the pen is very nice and as I said earlier... looks and feels much more expensive than it was. But here is where I have a problem... the pen does not glide smoothly when I am writing. It does ok, but here is a hint of scratching when I write. I am pretty heavy handed, and I might need to go to a bigger size.. but I find myself starting with this pen, but then I end up grabbing another pen because I just don't like how it writes. I thought I might have had a bad pen, so I tried all of them and had the same experience, so I think I need to keep looking and possibly go up a size.

Rating: 5, Review: These are my favorite pens. They are easy to grip and write so smoothly. I love keeping a few sets to give as gifts. They are really great.
Rating: 5, Review: I originally bought the five pack of these to be used for the guest book at my wedding a few weeks back. Thankfully all of them were returned to me afterward, and I just spent a rainy afternoon using them to write out thank you cards. Normally this would be no big deal (minus the hand cramp), but as a left-handed person, I was resigned to the usual smeared letters and scrubbing I'd have to do on my fingers afterward.  Shocked - SHOCKED - to find out this wasn't the case. Not one letter of the ink smeared, and my fingers stayed clean. By far the best pens I've ever purchased, and now I'm going to have to hide them from my husband, who is a boring old righty and won't understand the treasure he holds.
Rating: 3, Review: Pen leaked. Cute
Rating: 5, Review: Love the quality and feel of this pen.
Rating: 2, Review: The pens are super cute and wrote great for the first few uses. But then after about a week of use at office desk, ink only writes partially. Would not recommend.
Rating: 5, Review: I love love love these pens, so much that I spent a small fortune on several packs to give out to my coworkers. They just do not have a long writing life.
Rating: 2, Review: The ink does not come out consistently. I'm trying on different papers and it seems to have better luck with sticky notes but when I'm trying to write on other paper (e.g., planner), the ink does not come out consistently. When it does, it's smooth and nice and writes well. But unfortunately I've had to shake it (which hasn't been helpful either) often. When it does come out consistently, it dries faster than similar pens, but not as quickly as I would like because it can still smudge. I only just got the pens but I've been using them a lot. I'll come back to this if I find that my thoughts about them changes, but other than the comfort of holding the pens, I probably would not buy again.
Rating: 5, Review: These pens write so smooth without smudging. The have a velvety smooth finish. These have become me new favorite pens.
Rating: 2, Review: Brand new out of the package, I have to rewrite over letters because the ink is sporadically coming out. Very frustrating
Rating: 5, Review: Super aesthetically pleasing. Makes my desk just feel so clean with these pen. Gives me a super cute hand writing as well. The grip is nice and feels really smooth. Great pricing as well.
Rating: 5, Review: Very nice pens. Smooth writing and nice black line. I'll buy them again.
Rating: 5, Review: I adore these pens. Not only are they smooth and crisp to write with, but the texture of the pen itself provides a nice grip even for someone with shaky hands (such as myself). The colors are pretty and I find myself ditching my other stationary just to use these ornate little pens. They do smudge a bit if you move your hand over the ink too soon, but this happens with so many pens I can hardly fault it for what may be my hapless carelessness. Either way, I love them. Great quality for the price.
Rating: 5, Review: If you love pens, that have fine writing. You must get these. Perfect, especially if you work in an office setting. You know we all need that special pen to write with.
Rating: 1, Review: I thought it was all black ink Maybe I misunderstood In any case I didn’t like these pens Hard to hold and write
Rating: 2, Review: They are very cute and very soft and nice to hold, the ink isn't very smooth and they leak everywhere if you aren't super careful. They arent as juicy as i was expecting. Definitely would not buy again and can't return cause I threw the packaging away.
Rating: 5, Review: I love these pens and will refuse to use any other pen at work!

Rating: 3, Review: ""I purchased the Canon PG-243/CL-244 Ink Multi-Pack for my Canon TR4520 printer, and it's been a mixed bag. The ink quality is decent, with vibrant colors and acceptable print quality. However, I've experienced some issues with the ink cartridges themselves.  Firstly, the ink levels seem to deplete faster than expected, which can be frustrating. Additionally, I've encountered occasional clogs and print head alignment issues, which require frequent cleaning and maintenance.  On the plus side, the multi-pack includes both pigment black and color ink cartridges, which is convenient. The price is also relatively affordable compared to genuine Canon ink.  Overall, while this ink multi-pack gets the job done, it's not without its drawbacks. If you're looking for a budget-friendly option and are willing to tolerate some minor issues, this might be a decent choice. However, if you prioritize top-notch print quality and reliability, you may want to consider other options.""  Rating: 3 stars (adequate but with some issues)

Also if you have ink from the subscription service and stop the subscription the printer will not work with that ink. It’ll make you buy the subscription again or purchase different ink which is a bit ridiculous… everything doesn’t have to be a subscription.
Rating: 1, Review: Terrible product. Waste of money. HP sucks. Software sucks. Printer sucks. Scam
Rating: 5, Review: Works great for me
Rating: 1, Review: I ordered and received this printer with high expectations. I disconnected my old printer, set this one up and connected power and started to load the software and connect it to my Verizon FIOS wifi.  That's when the installation media told me that the ""wireless printer"" would NOT connect to Wifi!!!  It will ONLY work with 2.4 GHz WiFi speed!! It will NOT work with my Verizon FIOS 5 GHz WiFi!!  I went back to the Amazon website and looked through the details of this printer's settings. NOWHERE was it stated that the printer had a required WiFi speed.  Back it went this afternoon. I could not help but wonder what ELSE about this printer was not being communicated.
Rating: 5, Review: Good cost and excellent printer.
Rating: 1, Review: The media could not be loaded. This things takes fooooooever to print a single page. It took 30 minutes for me to print 5 pages. Ridiculous! Do not buy if time is of the essence!!!!!
Rating: 2, Review: First off this is a major pain to set up (connect). Be aware it has specific requirements for initial set up - 2.4 internet and a desktop/laptop can be hard to find the correct combination. It cannot be set up on 5G. However, it says once it is set up via 2.4 then 5G can be used to print. I cannot confirm this. Nowhere did it say any of this in the description. I was only made aware via paperwork provided in the box. It took me 4 different attempts/locations/combinations of the above to get mine to work... It does not say Hotspots can be used to print and there are no instructions on how to do so. I had to contact HP Support. Even then they tried to tell me I needed Wifi. You do not. You can print via your Hotspot, if you made it through the hair-pulling process of initial setup. The printer has to be in WIFI-DIRECT mode to print via Hotspot. Press Info & Resume buttons at the same time and an icon of a printer with a phone beside it will appear. Good luck!
Rating: 1, Review: I have constant issues with this printer. To begin, there is no paper tray, not even a built in one, so when you print, the papers go everywhere and they get mixed up. The controls are difficult to figure out and I had to Google how to factory reset it when I couldn't figure out how to change the wifi. Now, it is constantly disconnecting from my wifi preventing me from printing and it's not an issue with the wifi because everything else connected to it works just fine. 0/10 DO NOT RECOMMEND.

Rating: 1, Review: Difficult to set up. HP app is ridiculously slow and I'm not able to enroll in Instant Ink with the app or online--every time I click on ""enroll,"" I am looped back to the intro page. Printed 50 pages, now it doesn't print at all--just blank pages. The ink is showing half full. Spend your $$ on anything but an HP. Seriously.
Rating: 2, Review: DIFFICULT TO USE WHEN I NEED TO. DO NOT ALWAYS PRINT
Rating: 4, Review: Sometimes it would print and then it wouldn't. It would go off line. I finally found a number to call and they insisted I needed to do a remote. I felt like I didn't have a choice. They tried to sell me a winzip updater for at least 139.00. Then nothing about the printer would work. I am not sure what they did!!!!! I am not sure why you felt this was a positive review. Anything but. NOT HAPPY WITH THIS PRODUCT. I don't think I would ever buy a HP printer again.
Rating: 1, Review: Multiple times this printer has given us issues with connection to our internet. This hasn’t happened in the past with other printers. The troubleshooting is a pain and takes forever. I canceled my monthly subscription for their ink and they shut me down. So now I can’t even use it to make copies. Don’t waste your time and money on this horrible product.

Rating: 1, Review: Printer worked great then had some severe connectivity issues. But even worse than that HP will hold your printer hostage over the instant ink subscription! So to keep using the printer you already paid for, now you MUST pay them an additional monthly fee or throw out perfectly good ink just to get some “non-subscription” cartridges. What a joke! I am also amazed that this bait and switch tactic is somehow legal…. Beware of this outright SCAM and look elsewhere for a printer!

Rating: 1, Review: stop working
Rating: 1, Review: I am writing this review 9 months after i bought it. I spend more time trying to figure out how to make this printer work than actually using it.  First, I had so many pages that were printed wrong… so waste of time, paper and ink.  Second, I enrolled for the ink with the app. When I decided i did not wanted to be enrolled and i canceled my membership, the ink could not work anymore with my printer. The customer service explained me that it’s because i am not enrolled anymore so i need to buy a different type of ink for it to work. So my brand new ink is waste as well as my money.  And last, when i ask the company hp to return my printer because of many issues, they wouldn’t even tho my printer is still under warranty. I spend 3 hours with somebody trying to get my issues fixed for nothing.  So save your time and money. Buy another printer. And i know i am not the only one because my friend bought the same printer and hers stopped working after a year.  Also it’s all connected so won’t work without the app and all the shenanigan.

Rating: 5, Review: The media could not be loaded. A sub paper comes in variety of sizes I personally utilize the 8x11 and 8x14. Unlike other brands you'll always know what side is the printable side cuz they have a sub printed on the back so the front will always be plain white and that is your printable side colors are vibrant won't go back to my other paper highly recommend.
Rating: 5, Review: I love this sublimation paper. I was using the Sawgrass paper but ran out and ordered A-Sub off Amazon because I needed it fast. First, I love that there is writing on the wrong side so you don't mistakenly send the paper through the printer and get it printed on the wrong side wasting expensive ink and paper. . Secondly, the ink transfer is amazing. The sawgrass paper always had tons of ink left on the page, this paper just barely has an outline of the image left on it because the ink has fully transferred to the sublimated item. I highly recommend this paper!!

Rating: 1, Review: Paper has no adhesive to the item you are printing on. Therefore it will slide all over the place and is impossible to work with. The slightest movement with transfer paper means a ruined piece, marks and double lines everywhere. STAY AWAY!!!

Rating: 5, Review: Review: The Bic Mechanical Mentals have become an essential part of my everyday writing arsenal. As someone who values reliability and durability in their stationery, these mechanical pencils have exceeded my expectations.  First and foremost, the build quality of these pencils is top-notch. The metal barrel provides a reassuring weight and sturdiness, making them feel more substantial than other plastic alternatives. This durability ensures that they can withstand the rigors of daily use without any issues.  The 0.7mm lead size is perfect for both writing and sketching, offering a balance between precision and durability. The lead advances smoothly with each click, eliminating the need for constant sharpening and ensuring a consistent writing experience.  I also appreciate the eraser functionality at the top of the pencil. While it's not the largest eraser, it gets the job done for quick corrections and edits on the fly. Plus, the convenient refillable eraser design means I can easily replace it when needed, extending the lifespan of the pencil.  One of the standout features of these mechanical pencils is their affordability. Despite their high-quality construction, they are priced competitively, making them accessible to students, professionals, and artists alike.  Overall, I couldn't be happier with the Bic Mechanical Mentals. They combine durability, functionality, and affordability into one sleek package, making them a must-have for anyone in need of reliable writing instruments. Whether you're taking notes in class, sketching out ideas, or drafting documents, these pencils won't let you down. Highly recommended!

Rating: 5, Review: I had an old pad and wrist support, but it had been packed hastily and sat in the garage for a while. I ordered this, not sure of it, but it is exactly what I need. The bottom is sticky so it does move when you move the mouse, the wrist rest is soft and comfortable, and the pad works well with my mouse.
Rating: 5, Review: I've been using this mousepad for about a week, and it's been fantastic. The non-slip pad on the bottom ensures it stays firmly in place on my desk, so no need to constantly readjust. The surface is incredibly smooth, allowing my mouse to glide effortlessly over the fabric. The wrist pad provides just the right level of firmness and height, offering comfortable support throughout the day. Highly recommended!
Rating: 3, Review: This is our second purchase. The first ruptured at the wrist support but we loved it so much we purchased a second. Hooefully this one will last longer - if not, I'll revisit this review. If the material at the wrist support weren't so weak, this would be a 5-star product. For the price though we bought it again.

Comfy wrist pad. Basic mousepad functionality. Excellent.
Rating: 5, Review: I bought this mouse pad a long while ago and I'm still using it today. In fact, I'm using it right now as I'm typing up this review.

Rating: 5, Review: Love this mouse pad it’s a little wider so it gives you a larger surface area. Very cute print. Mouse moves smoothly across the surface.
Rating: 3, Review: I love the size & the wrist support. It works well with my wired mouse, but not my wireless (not sure if that's the mouse or what). The only problem is the pilling. It doesn't seem to affect usage, but it drives me nuts. I can feel it on the side of my hand & it's super annoying! It's been about 7 months, ~40 hours/week, so take what you will from that. I'll probably try to shave it (like a sweater) and if that doesn't work, just get another. Not a fan of today's disposable world, but here we are.
Rating: 5, Review: Easy to clean, works well with my wrist. eases the carpel tunel, beautiful print.
Rating: 2, Review: I should have returned this product!! This is the most uncomfortable 'ergonomic' mouse pad with wrist support. I could go on and on with the negatives but suffice it to say that the 'gel wrist support' is a hard surface. Far too high and far too hard that it hurts. Don't buy it.

Rating: 1, Review: A lot of features on this mouse pad are really good - nice wrist rest, good non stick grippy base, good amount of room for mouse movement. BUT the pad itself, where the mouse travels, is coming apart (after one month almost to the day) so that the mouse will not longer track properly, thus rendering this product useless.  Great idea, need better materials  UPDATE No the pad was thrown away after reading this review. However I was offered a full refund by the company without even contacting them, which was very nice.

Rating: 4, Review: Not the thickest sheet protectors, but will get the job done. Packaged in a bag not a box, so susceptible to creases if not delivered with care.
Rating: 2, Review: Not thick enough for me. Hard to get plastic to part so you can get paper in.
Rating: 5, Review: So, I wound up buying these sheet protectors for some binders I am creating, after the local store I was originally buying them from, had no more in stock, and stayed out of stock for a while. I did not realize until receiving these, how poor of quality the ones I had been using actually were. I will never go back to the others and will soon be ordering more of these. There is a very, very slight price difference (literally a few cents) in the price per quantity, but the quality of these cannot be beat. These are the only sheet protectors I will be using from her on out.
Rating: 5, Review: I have many uses for these page protectors! I make quilts, so my patterns, fabric swatches and templates are all kept together. Good recipes are important and I want them to be kept fresh even while I make a mess cooking. On and on...I love them! Reasonably priced, quickly delivered, glad I bought them!
Rating: 5, Review: Great for keeping important pages and pictures safe.

Rating: 4, Review: Don’t like the opening it is difficult for a person with any hand problems. Twisting the cap off is very hard.
Rating: 5, Review: great
Rating: 5, Review: I use sharpies all the time in my classroom, at the camp I work at, and around the house. They are so convenient to label many different items. I guess my only complaint is that it doesn't work well if the surface is damp or wet. That, and when a kid gets a hold of it and then you have to figure out how to get permanent marker off of different surfaces (bug spray works amazingly well!).
Rating: 5, Review: outstanding quality
Rating: 5, Review: Great long lasting permanent markers! All except for 1 marker! The 1st marker put of the packaging was bone dry. The cap was on it, however not as tight fitting as the other 4 markers.
Rating: 5, Review: I love to have these around the shop because it always seems like I need to mark something and misplaced my other one. I keep one at each of my benches and then one near the saws so I can always make a quick mark.  I always buy the Sharpie brand because they seem to last longer than the generics and the tips seem to be more firm and not get all mushroomed. The generic ones are cheaper but I found that for how much longer the Sharpie brand lasts and how much more resilient it is, I get a better deal just sticking with the name brand on these. The Milwaukee branded ones are a close second, and almost indistinguishable from the Sharpie ones, and they are probably made by the same company because their price is about the same with the only difference being the diameter of the tip.  Can't go wrong with these IMHO!  Hope you found this helpful!
Rating: 5, Review: they do a great job
Rating: 3, Review: Can't understand why I can't find these in the store any more, but they literally didn't last as long as the knockoffs.

Rating: 5, Review: I have several of these black markers. They come in handy often, sometimes when I had not expected it. There is a limited quantity of ink in this marker, so I keep several on hand for when one dies.

Rating: 5, Review: All sharpies are great value and last forever. I feel like I write a million words which each one which is helpful to have the fine point so that you can write more clearly. Would definitely recommend these if you want great value and to be able to write notes
Rating: 1, Review: It comes with a plastic cap. And I was going to return it and I can’t even take it to an Amazon return center. If they’re gonna say it has a steel case, the whole thing should be steel. Even the clip part that you’re supposed to clip tear shirt or whatever is plastic. They make it look like it’s metal but it’s not, I was hoping to find something that wasn’t 50 bucks or 100 bucks because there are some options out there but they’re way too expensive. I thought this would be great but it was just a disappointment.

Rating: 5, Review: Sharpies are my favorite!
Rating: 5, Review: This product is perfect for those who have sight issues (cataracts). I have no problem referring back to notes taken with a sharpie compared to a regular ballpoint. The only issue I have is that the ink typically bleeds through the paper. So you can't read what you write if you're using both sides of the sheet as in a lined notebook. This doesn't happen if the paper is thick enough such as blank computer paper or cardboard.

Es colorido y toma muy poco espacio. Es fácil de armar y mover de un lugar a otro. Estoy muy contenta con esta compra.
Rating: 3, Review: If you don't need this to store heavy items or have a toddler that will climb on it then this cart is just fine for you. I had an idea of how cheap this product would be when I bought it but I was still surprised at just how cheap the cart feels. The baskets are made from really cheap plastic so I wouldn't suggest using this for anything heavy like laundry detergent. And if you have a toddler that uses furniture to pull themselves up do not buy this.
Rating: 1, Review: Holy smokes….. horribly cheap… like wow, if I blow on it it might fall over. Buying something more sturdy as we speak. Don’t even attempt
Rating: 5, Review: I have had this for about 2 months now and my wheels are still on! A little wobbly but still handles great. Good quality and fits quite a few baby items for easy access. Love the color
Rating: 3, Review: Works. Much poorer quality than the metal one I ordered previously. It will do what I need it to, but would not reorder.
Rating: 4, Review: It's good & does the job for the price. It's lightweight material so it's not theBEST out there, but it's very decent.
Rating: 4, Review: The media could not be loaded. This cart is great for light objects like makeup bathroom essential. The car did lean when heavy items put in.

Rating: 5, Review: Cumplió con mis expectativas y mucho más . Muy cómodo para trasladar y más Gracias
Rating: 2, Review: Product is ok but it definitely does not roll on carpet well. It’s all plastic so the item is not the sturdiest. Because it is plastics, some of the parts wiggle and can come apart if you pull cart a certain way. I was being cheap by buying this one and regret it and should have got other ones with the metal options that are sturdier. I’m using this as a diaper/breast pump machine cart. Works ok.
Rating: 5, Review: I originally wanted a metal one to use for a breast feeding cart next to my bed. I reluctantly ordered this one and honestly, it works great. It is sturdy and when I move it around the wheels glide nicely and it doesn't feel like its going to topple over. I am going to re-purpose it for my sons books and I believe it will transition great. Good product.
Rating: 5, Review: Durable and works well
Rating: 2, Review: It's ok, not too stable at all. It's doing the job, I just can't move it around. Not much weight to it either.

Rating: 5, Review: I love this cart! I initially bought it for when my daughter was born as a diaper cart. Now that she’s older I use it as a little starter cart for my craft. The tray size is some what small but I feel like I’ve made it work. Plus you can always add more trays. It’s also easy to push on tile not so much carpet but still movable

Rating: 1, Review: Not easy to start and it splits. Waste of money. Should have zero stars.
Rating: 1, Review: I don’t know what they did to this tape, but it smells so foul. It’s disgusting.
Rating: 5, Review: I use this tape all the time for shipping and I've never had any problem. It sticks very well and the dispenser keeps it from sticking to itself so that's a big plus.

Rating: 5, Review: Solves the problem of finding the end of the tape. But do still keep a little clip on the end.
Rating: 5, Review: I especially like the ""sure start"". That has always been the most frustrating part of using packing tape.
Rating: 3, Review: These are very very small rolls and not heavy duty. I should have paid closer attention when ordering. Used the whole box in no time. Not recommended for packing moving boxes.
Rating: 2, Review: I bought this with high hopes, but the tape will split and shred when trying to start the roll. Always make sure you fold a small edge at the end so you can get it restarted if you need to. As another reviewer said it will not stick to itself. On cardboard it's fine, but it won't stick to anything slick
Rating: 4, Review: Like the tape. Don’t like the dispenser.
Rating: 1, Review: I use this tape all the time, literally thousands of uses, what happened to it? It would not stick and kept coming back off like I was using a piece of Saran wrap and not even tape. Wont buy this again, I will shop only for Heavy Duty hopefully will get a better product.
Rating: 1, Review: I bought this for shipping the occasional packages . The marketing of SureStart and ""no splitting"" led me to this product. Well, maybe I received a defective batch. There are customer videos that show a starter piece of tape sticking up, so it's easy to start, regardless if you have long nails, etc. Mine do not.
Rating: 1, Review: This is the worst Scotch Tape I have ever purchased and I buy them all the time. Doesn't have any stickiness to it at all. Don't recommend.
Rating: 5, Review: I needed some packing tape and went through all of the choices on Amazon and also tried numberous other sites on the web. This package seemed to be the right price and the packing tape is perfect for shipping boxes that have to remain tightly closed in transit. I will buy this product every time.

Rating: 1, Review: Don’t waste your money
Rating: 2, Review: The reason why this canon printer is being a return so much is because of the deceptive advertising that says you can use it Wi-Fi to smart phones and tablets. One thing they do not tell you in the advertisement is you have to have a wireless router to use it there for there is no way to directly connected between the printer and your tablet or smart phone without going through a wireless router no possible way
Rating: 4, Review: I have a MacBook Pro and bought this as our first printer ever. I struggled with it the first day. I downloaded everything and the computer would now connect wirelessly. I wish the printer came with the usb printer cord because that initially solved the connection issue. Why I have it 4 stars. Feel like it should have came with that cord. Once I received the cord I ordered separately the computer connected just fine and worked great! Having no issues so far and I’m a few weeks into owning the printer
Rating: 5, Review: Easy to follow instructions and connectivity
Rating: 1, Review: I purchased this printer because I had a Cannon printer before. This one is not as good as the older model. It has broken already. The feed is not working at all so nothing prints. It does not give a way to fix this problem. I tried a factory reset and that did not work either.
Rating: 1, Review: I was under the impression that even if you purchase cheap product, it has the responsibility to AT LEAST function as the product it is labelled as. It might not work well, or for long. It might not have any bells and whistles... but at a bare minimum, it has to at least perform the task which it is labelled to perform, in some capacity.  Canon is obviously not under the same impression. This piece of junk does nothing but eat paper and jam. If it was labelled as a ""Paper Shredder"" or ""Paperweight"" I wouldn't feel so cheated. If you are looking for a printer that actually has the ability to apply ink to paper, this is not the machine for you.
Rating: 1, Review: This printer is terrible. It won't connect to the computer so we had to use our phones which took 3 hours to connect. Ran out of ink quickly. Literally only used it one day to print 25 sheets of paper that's it. awful! Spend more and get something better
Rating: 2, Review: I put brand new ink to print. says low ink..... then I change another brand new one. says low ink again. all inks are purchased from the official site......this is a bug.
Rating: 1, Review: Absolute garbage. Do yourself a favor and spend a little bit more. The few bucks you save is not worth the setup hassle. If you buy this don't say you weren't warned.
Rating: 1, Review: Don’t waste your money on this printer, it won’t even connect to WiFi. Bought this as a replacement for the first one that died. Canon used to be top of the line, but they’ve gone backwards so far that we actually thinking about switching back to HP.
Rating: 2, Review: Truly do not buy this printer if you ever want to print more than ONE piece of paper at a time. with the right settings you can get some fabulous prints and i enjoyed the small pack of photo paper that came free with my original purchase. Little did i know over half would be chewed up by this print like an untrained dog. Truly a marvel in improper building. The scan top was Flimsy at best and felt like it could snap off with just a little pushing, the interior is unlit which is fine enough but knowing so many printers have a small LED to help guide self repair and ink replacement puts this one behind most. Brand loyalty is dead because HP milks money from you and canon makes bad product.
Rating: 3, Review: I am unable to print wirelessly from my PC. Printing using a USB cable works. Wireless printing from an Ipad works. Can someone suggest a solution?

Rating: 1, Review: Had HP printer, though I didn’t know that you had to buy a subscription in order to print/ copy ur things or other HP would block the use of the printer! So I bought this cannon it does put the paper through to print. So they can have this back!
Rating: 5, Review: The printer is great but a lot to learn of how to print different ways
Rating: 1, Review: Sent rt back and took forever to refund... Still waiting on a decision.
Rating: 5, Review: I do not understand why some reviewers claim that setup is complicated; using the accompanying CD and following the instructions it is a snap. Then, once installed, the printer did not work with AirPrint from my iPhone. After a few tries I realized that the printer had turned itself off. Googling the automatic turn off I learned it came as default with 4 hours before turning off. Disabling the automatic turn off solved also the AirPrint problem. Now both iPhone and iPad find the printer on my LAN.
Rating: 1, Review: FIrst time I had a wireless printer. Every single time I turn the printer off it disconnects and it takes abot 30 minutes to get it to communicate with my computer again. I'm glad it didn't cost much because I am throwing it in the trash!
Rating: 5, Review: Wish it was easier to link to phone
Rating: 2, Review: I ordered this printer May 24, 2002 and after weeks of sputtering today it died. Was used sparingly in an at home situation. Should have lasted much longer
Rating: 1, Review: First, despite every other Canon printer setup being rather simple and intuitive... this one isn't. I literally spent several hours for 6 days reading questions from others about how they couldn't connect theirs either.  Next, forget all of the wonderful features Canon has offered for decades... this is a bare bones printer. There's no panel interface, it has just a a black and color copy button, a stop button, wifi and power. Dedicated scan button? If only. Estimated ink levels? Not a chance.  Speaking of ink, this printer doesn't have the individual colors, just the color ink and the black ink, which is super wasteful. For instance, if you use a lot of Cyan but not Magenta, your color ink cartridge will be ""out"" once you no longer have blue.  Additionally, the photo quality is terrible. It's blurry and the colors are off. After my previous Canon printer stopped after a year and a half and Canon said they no longer supported the model, I was hesitant in spending another $350 on a printer. But this is trash. Even the standard printing is barely legible. That last picture is the last page of my bank statement and should say, This Page Intentionally Left Blank, but you wouldn't know it.
Rating: 1, Review: They cheap out and don't send a USB cable, and the cable port is printer-specific so I can't just use a USB A or C cable. Wi-fi setup does not work and keep erroring out. Now I have to wait another 2 days for the cable to arrive and the emergency print I needed cannot be done. Avoid this garbage.
Rating: 2, Review: Had this printer for barely over a month and will no longer connect to work wirelessly! Wasted 2 hours troubleshooting and to no avail. So frustrating and piece of junk! Never buying a canon again.

It does.
Rating: 5, Review: I'm incredibly impressed with the HP 67XL Tri-color High-yield Ink Cartridge. After numerous disappointing experiences with off-brand cartridges, I decided to give this genuine HP product a try, and I'm so glad I did!  The print quality is simply outstanding. The colors are vibrant, rich, and true-to-life, making my printouts look professional and eye-catching. Even after printing hundreds of pages, the quality remains consistent and sharp.  The page yield is incredible! This high-yield cartridge has lasted me significantly longer than the standard cartridges, saving me a considerable amount of money in the long run. I can confidently recommend this product to anyone who needs to print frequently without compromising on quality or breaking the bank.  Compatibility was a non-issue, as this cartridge worked flawlessly with my HP DeskJet 4100 Series printer right out of the box. No fiddling or adjustments were required – it was a seamless plug-and-play experience.  I couldn't be happier with my purchase. The HP 67XL Tri-color High-yield Ink Cartridge has exceeded my expectations in every aspect, from print quality to longevity and ease of use. If you're looking for a reliable, high-performance ink cartridge, this is an absolute must-buy. Highly recommended!
Rating: 1, Review: Printed a few pages with the new color cartridge and it was streaked. Went to print again a month later and it's out of ink. No stars.
Rating: 5, Review: Gracias
Rating: 2, Review: This seller sent my ink in a timely fashion. That's the good part, and the only reason for the 2 stars, otherwise it would have been zero stars. What I didn't know was that I'd been sold a cartridge that shouldn't have been used by anyone except HP and their ""Instant Ink"" subscription program. It took me 2 hours + to finally look at the cartridge and see that it was coded 674/30S, where my regular, spent cartridge simply had the 674 on it. More time to track down all this nonsense at a $30 price tag. Complete waste of Ink, time and money.
Rating: 5, Review: Perfect for my printer. Does a great job

Rating: 1, Review: I bought this ink to replace my cartridge in the future. I'v had it for 6 weeks and I'm ready to use it and I notice the box was taped shut and the original wrap was cut. I can't return.
Rating: 5, Review: We use this brand all the time, sometimes you can’t find it in the stores. It may be sold out, but we can always count on Amazon to carry products we use daily.
Rating: 5, Review: These inks are sometimes hard to find in XL. They are always available on Amazon.
Rating: 5, Review: Purchased a new printer and then needed to add some additional ink. So far all is well.
Rating: 1, Review: These HP cartridges are a huge rip off. I might get 50 pages or so per set of black and color cartridges ($60). This is on the HP 6400 series printer I have (the worst printer I ever made the mistake of buying). The printer was less than $100 and I'm spending $120 month for ink.  So long HP. I bought a different brand of printer today with a better ink solution.

Rating: 5, Review: Better value than Walmart, Office Depot or Costco.
Rating: 1, Review: Corporate America continues to ignore environmental and consumer concerns. Unfortunately, this is why regulation is necessary. Each tape dispenser is one-sided and that's not clear from the photography included on the site. Also there's very little tape only 18 yd total on each dispenser. This is also not made very clear on the site. Why not provide one or two dispensers complete with both sides and the same amount of tape that you get in six of these ? Also, I noted there are lots of complaints about the teeth, not perforating the tape easily. I checked the Amazon offering and the reviews were not very good so I didn't order those either
Rating: 5, Review: I have used it for years!
Rating: 5, Review: My wife uses an awful lot of scotch tape on her projects, so she buys in bulk. However, I think it's more efficient to get a ""real"" (i.e., permanent) dispenser or two, and then just buy the ""naked"" rolls. So, I purchased said permanent dispenser for her, also from Amazon. She tells me she'll use it after finishing these rolls.

Rating: 4, Review: Came as expected, same magic tape as purchased in store. Like that I can buy in bulk and have on hand for when I need it last minute. Came in new packaging and arrived as expected.  I always forget though that it is not the prettiest option for wrapping as it is not as invisible as some other options which is why I did deduct one star.  In comparing prices the price I paid was a good value. When comparing be sure to look at inches per roll. As the same brand is packaged in different sizes such as 325in and 500in. These are listed as 650in. per roll.

Rating: 5, Review: Like: Flexible Good hold Dislike: Backing did not easily separate. I was using 1.5” pieces- backing did not easily separate preferring to lift off tape piece - not sure if tape was old or had been stored in a hot warehouse.
Rating: 3, Review: It appears that what I used this tape on will be stuck for some time. So far, so good. But the backing tape is almost impossible to remove. I finally hit on the idea of using tweezers with a sharp tip that I could slide under the backing tape to separate it. For this reason I would not recommend this tape for a large project. It proved hard enough on a small project.
Rating: 4, Review: Gorilla Tough & Clear Double Sided Adhesive Mounting Tape is a reliable choice for mounting projects. Its extra-large size and clear design offer versatility for various applications. While it holds strong and is durable, occasional difficulty in removing residue warrants a 4-star rating.

Rating: 5, Review: I love these pens. Sometimes the ink can come out a little slow but you can’t beat the convenience of being erasable.
Rating: 5, Review: Haven’t opened it yet but I think they’re just regular erasable pens 👍🏽
Rating: 5, Review: I bought these for my mom. She loves them. They actually are erasable.
Rating: 2, Review: I love these pens except they are too expensive for the minimal amount of ink. These do not last long at all and I use them only for my planner so it's not like they get heavily used for much. So disappointed.
Rating: 5, Review: This product is as described, erasable! I use it doing art, especially watercolor. There is an eraser on the pen end and if you would rather, the ink can be erased by using heat. Would buy again.
Rating: 4, Review: It's amazing how one can write notes in the ""notebook"" and then scan the QR to save. Very impressive tech. My only nock on it is the pens have to be pressed hard or at a drastic angle. They sometimes ""skip spots ""when writing

Rating: 1, Review: The media could not be loaded. Works but is not that good …I have other betten then this
Rating: 1, Review: They are great erasable ink pens BUT they go dry right away. Also, I addressed an envelope with it and the print faded so it was difficult to read, don't know if it was the heat or sunshine?
Rating: 5, Review: I repurchased these for my son. He's used them since elementary school (3rd grade) and every year he asks me for more. They're the best erasable pen we've tried. So many others don't quite as well when using the eraser or don't write well. He's never complained and they last a while. I would definitely recommend especially for kids transitioning from pencil use to pen. They are very reasonably priced and you can get them in 2 days or less.

Rating: 5, Review: These pens are great they easily erase without much force I wish it looked a little better but Hey they worked great.
Rating: 5, Review: These are everything you wanted the book fair erasable pens to be. Works best if you wait a a few seconds to allow the ink to dry down before scrubbing it off otherwise it will smear. Great if you like to write in pen but you’re a perfectionist and can’t deal with cross outs.

Rating: 4, Review: I love the color and performance but overtime the color will run out and you will have to buy more ink
Rating: 5, Review: I didn't have high expectations for this pen, I bought this out of curiosity and since Pilot is known to make quality pens. My experience with any erasable pens have been poor at best, always smudging or ripping apart paper like a rabid beast, or in best case scenario, not erasing at all. This does none of that. The ink color is more gray than black but flows smoothly like any other gel pen. And it actually erases! The eraser is tough but with some gentle rub, the ink does erase. I would recommend this pen to anyone who uses whiteout fairly regularly and give this a shot. And with the price of the pens, it is worth a try.
Rating: 5, Review: My previse job introduced me to these erasable pens. Now I am addicted. I won't use anything else.
Rating: 1, Review: Worked enough to write my name, and then went dead.
Rating: 5, Review: My favorite to use as a nurse! It's been my mission over the past few years to find the best pen and this is it. Gel writing and very easily erasable, can't beat it!

Rating: 5, Review: Only bought this to laminate my empty seed packs when we planted the garden to mark each row. So far it's been easy to do. Sets up quickly. Heats up quickly. Appears to create good seals around my seed packs. And so far no rain has messed up my cards. Can't vouch for other uses because haven't done anything else. But for garden row marking, it's worked well so far for us.
Rating: 1, Review: Worked fine until it didn't!!! There is only a month warranty unless you buy a longer one! This is terrible for such a large company!!!
Rating: 4, Review: First use went well, results as expected. However the plastic housing vibrates loudly. If you touch the plastic just below the exit slot, it stops vibrating. There were a lot of bad reviews on Scotches web site for this product 12 good 15 bad, and a few bad on Amazon a lot of 5 stars. We’ll see how it goes….

Rating: 4, Review: I bought other envelopes online for a standard invitation and the fit was so snug it was a chore stuffing them. I found these when searching for something better for the same celebrations thank you cards that followed hoping it would be less taxing. These accommodate so nicely, there is no struggle getting the standard size 'invitation' into them, but not so much extra room it looks mismatched. If you're ever stuffing large amounts of envelopes ALWAYS get the self adhesive ones like these - it made the process a breeze. For additional points, we use a ink stamp for our return address - these envelopes held the ink nicely and did not bleed.

Rating: 5, Review: Bought these for highlighting my Bible. They work amazing. No bleed through. Clean lines. Great colors. Super satisfied.
Rating: 2, Review: I'm not super impressed with these markers. I got them so I could highlight books without them bleeding. Since they said Bible safe I thought they would work, but they bleed through worse than any of my other highlighters! The colors are kind of weird too. The pinks are more brown than anything. I can still use them to highlight other things, but they are definitely not book safe.
Rating: 5, Review: My favorite, no bleed, highlighters to use in my Bible. This is my second time to order!
Rating: 1, Review: These definitely bleed through Bible pages. WARNING!
Rating: 5, Review: I love these highlighters. They are perfect for my Bible and books. I’ve tried them on both thin and thicker pages and they do not bleed through.
Rating: 4, Review: These look beautiful and not a bad price. I found that the ink does not match the actual color of the marker, in my case some of them looked identical so that was a bit disappointing. Other than that they are fine

They seriously haven't bled through, even the darker colors! I don't color code anymore cause that was too much, now I just switch out a color per day; it's nice to see where I left off. I will 100% be buying more! They are adorable!

Occasionally, it is hard to tell the colors apart, so I went ahead and wrote on the back of some of the highlighters what colors they were but overall, these are a great highlighter and option to help with your Bible study!

Rating: 5, Review: Love the highlighter set! The colors are very pretty and are very soft. I bought one set for my daughter and started using them a lot. So I bought several more for myself and for gifts. They work really well. My daughter uses them for her Bible, but I would not recommend the dark colors if you don’t want them to show on the other side with color. They do not bleed through, but the color shows a bit. I use them in my study workbooks and I love them. They work well. The price is good too.
Rating: 3, Review: The structure and design of the highlighters was wonderful. Made it easy to hold and to make a straight highlight line. However my mission for no bleed markers for my Bible continues...these bled through.

Rating: 5, Review: Mi hija no lo compraria si no estuviera totalmente segura de que son buenos.
Rating: 3, Review: I read a lot and I love to highlight. These markers don’t make me very happy. I am using the yellow and the beige and sometimes the pink and green. I don’t like when they don’t come out smooth on the paper and then you have to go back. That happens with the yellow as well. It makes a messy look. I will try to use up on something other than my Bible and Christian books. The girl on YouTube was using and recommended it, and it looked good, but it’s not for me. Will be going back to the original highlighters, just wish they didn’t make the other colors so dark. Because when you start and stop it just looks uneven.

Rating: 5, Review: The big box store where I used to get my ink cartridges has narrowed down their inventory so I need to order the cartridges online. They're easy to locate on Amazon's website. The ordering process is quick as is the delivery time. The cartridges look like you would expect new cartridges to look, and they last about the amount of time I would expect. Haven't had any issues with them.
