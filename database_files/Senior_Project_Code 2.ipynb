    "     \"review_text\": \"So I've tried several different docks and this seems to be the best for my new MacBook Air M1. I wanted to write a review because everybody is reviewing for Pro's and the Air is different BECAUSE of the power adapter that comes with it. The Air comes with a 30 watt power adapter so when I would plug it in through the dock it would not charge. The work around is to get a 60 watt power adapter which is also still compatible with the Air. The issue is the dock uses some of the power and not all of the 30 watts goes through to the computer and what little that did go through the computer did not recognize as being enough to charge. The 60 watt is working great and don't worry, I did verify all of this with both Apple and Belkin tech support. I'm using one very large external monitor (this doesn't work with dual monitors on the M1...not a Belkin thing it's and apple thing) both USB ports for various things and the 3.5mm sound out to a mixer/speakers and the charger for the computer.  It is really convenient as I only have to plug in the one thing into the thunderbolt and everything is up and running. The cable is short but I use my computer as a second screen and have a raised docking station for it to be at eye level. I mounted this dock to the back of that stand in the upper left so the connector just literally loops around and in. Very happy so far and will update if that changes.\",\n",
